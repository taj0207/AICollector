- [In a sea of agents, AWS bets on structured adherence and spec fidelity](https://venturebeat.com/ai/in-a-sea-of-agents-aws-bets-on-structured-adherence-and-spec-fidelity) — 21:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > Despite new methods emerging, enterprises continue to turn to autonomous coding agents and code generation platforms. The competition to keep developers working on their platforms, coming from tech companies, has also heated up.AWS thinks its offering, Kiro, and new capabilities to ensure behavioral adherence set up a large differentiator in the increasingly crowded coding agent space. Kiro, first launched in July on public preview, is now generally available with new features, including property-based testing for behavior and a command-line interface (CLI) capability to tailor custom agents. Kiro is an agentic coding tool with its own IDE to help create agents and applications from prototype to production.Deepak Singh, AWS vice president for developer agents and experiences, told VentureBeat that Kiro “keeps the fun” of coding while providing it structure.“The way I like to say it is, what Kiro does is it allows you to talk to your agent and work with your agent to build software just like you would do with any other agent,” Singh said. “But what Kiro does is it brings this structured way of writing that software, which we call spec-driven development, to specs that take your ideas, converts them into things that will endure over time. So the outcome is more robust, maintainable code.”In addition to new features, AWS is offering startups in most countries one year of free credits to Kiro Pro+ and expanded access to Teams. Behavioral adherence and checkpointing built inOne of the new features of Kiro is property-based testing and checkpointing. A problem some enterprises face with AI-generated code is that it can sometimes be difficult to judge accuracy and how closely the agents adhere to their intended purpose. AWS noted in a blog post that “whoever writes the tests (human or AI) is limited by their own biases — they have to think of all the different, specific scenarios to test the code against, and they’ll miss edge cases they didn’t think of. AI models often ‘game’ the solution by modifying tests instead of fixing code.”“What property-based testing does is it takes a specification, it takes a spec, and from that, it identifies properties your code should have, and it basically creates potentially hundreds of testing scenarios to verify that your code is doing what you intended it to as identified in the spec, and it does all the automatically,” Singh said. Singh said that organizations can upload their specifications, and the Kiro agent can start identifying what is missing, even before the code review process begins. Property-based testing matches the specified behavior, aka your instructions, to what the code is doing. Kiro can help users write it in their specifications based on the EARS format. For example, if a company is building a car sales app, the specification would read:“For any user and any car listing, WHEN the user adds the car to favorites, THE System SHALL display that car in their favorites list. PBT then automatically tests this with User A adding Car #1, User B adding Car #500, User C adding multiple cars, users with special characters in usernames, cars with various statuses (new, used, certified), and hundreds more combinations, catching edge cases and verifying that implementation matches your intent.”As opposed to a traditional unit test specification, which states: If a user adds car #5 to their favorites, then it will appear on their list.Kiro will then identify examples of the code violating the specifications and present them to the user. Kiro also now allows for checkpointing, so developers can go back to a previous change if something goes wrong. CLI codingThe second major new feature of Kiro is Kiro CLI, which brings the Kiro coding agent directly into a developer’s CLI.AWS said the Kiro CLI utilizes some functionalities from the Q Developer CLI—its in-line coding assistant, launched in October 2024—to enable users to access the agent from the command line. It also allows developers to start building custom agents, such as a backend specialist, a frontend agent, and a DevOps agent, tailored to an organization’s codebase.Singh said developers have their own unique ways of working, so it’s important for coding agent providers like AWS to meet them, where they are. Kiro CLI allows users to:Stay in the terminal without the need for context switchingStructuring AI workflows with custom agentsHave one set up for two environments since MCP servers and other tools work in both the Kiro version on the IDE or the CLIFast automation to format code or manage logs through automated commandsCoding agents competitionKiro, though, is just one of many coding agent platforms cropping up and competing for enterprise usage. From OpenAI’s GPT-Codex, which unifies its Codex coding assistant with IDEs, CLIs, and other workflows, to Google’s Gemini CLI, it's clear that more developers demand easy access to coding agents where they do their work. And enterprises are demanding more from coding agents. For example, Anthropic made its Claude Code platform available on the web and mobile. Some coding platforms also allow users to choose which model to use for their coding. Singh said Kiro doesn’t rely on just one LLM; instead, it routes to the best model for the work, including AWS models. At launch in July, Kiro was based on Claude Sonnet 3.7 and 4.0. The current iteration leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5. Well-known brands like Monday.com have noted the significant benefits of AI-powered coding, demonstrating that enterprises will likely continue to utilize these platforms in the future. “We saw that the mental model changes for developers, but it’s not just about becoming more efficient; it’s also how they organize around the way they work now,” Singh said.
- [From shiny object to sober reality: The vector database story, two years later](https://venturebeat.com/ai/from-shiny-object-to-sober-reality-the-vector-database-story-two-years-later) — 10:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > When I first wrote “Vector databases: Shiny object syndrome and the case of a missing unicorn” in March 2024, the industry was awash in hype. Vector databases were positioned as the next big thing — a must-have infrastructure layer for the gen AI era. Billions of venture dollars flowed, developers rushed to integrate embeddings into their pipelines and analysts breathlessly tracked funding rounds for Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Milvus and a dozen others.The promise was intoxicating: Finally, a way to search by meaning rather than by brittle keywords. Just dump your enterprise knowledge into a vector store, connect an LLM and watch magic happen.Except the magic never fully materialized.Two years on, the reality check has arrived: 95% of organizations invested in gen AI initiatives are seeing zero measurable returns. And, many of the warnings I raised back then — about the limits of vectors, the crowded vendor landscape and the risks of treating vector databases as silver bullets — have played out almost exactly as predicted.Prediction 1: The missing unicornBack then, I questioned whether Pinecone — the poster child of the category — would achieve unicorn status or whether it would become the “missing unicorn” of the database world. Today, that question has been answered in the most telling way possible: Pinecone is reportedly exploring a sale, struggling to break out amid fierce competition and customer churn.Yes, Pinecone raised big rounds and signed marquee logos. But in practice, differentiation was thin. Open-source players like Milvus, Qdrant and Chroma undercut them on cost. Incumbents like Postgres (with pgVector) and Elasticsearch simply added vector support as a feature. And customers increasingly asked: “Why introduce a whole new database when my existing stack already does vectors well enough?”The result: Pinecone, once valued near a billion dollars, is now looking for a home. The missing unicorn indeed. In September 2025, Pinecone appointed Ash Ashutosh as CEO, with founder Edo Liberty moving to a chief scientist role.  The timing is telling: The leadership change comes amid increasing pressure and questions over its long-term independence.  Prediction 2: Vectors alone won’t cut itI also argued that vector databases by themselves were not an end solution. If your use case required exactness —  l ike searching for “Error 221” in a manual—a pure vector search would gleefully serve up “Error 222” as “close enough.” Cute in a demo, catastrophic in production.That tension between similarity and relevance has proven fatal to the myth of vector databases as all-purpose engines. “Enterprises discovered the hard way that semantic ≠ correct.”Developers who gleefully swapped out lexical search for vectors quickly reintroduced… lexical search in conjunction with vectors. Teams that expected vectors to “just work” ended up bolting on metadata filtering, rerankers and hand-tuned rules. By 2025, the consensus is clear: Vectors are powerful, but only as part of a hybrid stack.Prediction 3: A crowded field becomes commoditizedThe explosion of vector database startups was never sustainable. Weaviate, Milvus (via Zilliz), Chroma, Vespa, Qdrant — each claimed subtle differentiators, but to most buyers they all did the same thing: store vectors and retrieve nearest neighbors.Today, very few of these players are breaking out. The market has fragmented, commoditized and in many ways been swallowed by incumbents. Vector search is now a checkbox feature in cloud data platforms, not a standalone moat.Just as I wrote then: Distinguishing one vector DB from another will pose an increasing challenge. That challenge has only grown harder. Vald, Marqo, LanceDB, PostgresSQL, MySQL HeatWave, Oracle 23c, Azure SQL, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j, SingleStore, ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, Apahce Solr… the list goes on.The new reality: Hybrid and GraphRAGBut this isn’t just a story of decline — it’s a story of evolution. Out of the ashes of vector hype, new paradigms are emerging that combine the best of multiple approaches.Hybrid Search: Keyword + vector is now the default for serious applications. Companies learned that you need both precision and fuzziness, exactness and semantics. Tools like Apache Solr, Elasticsearch, pgVector and Pinecone’s own “cascading retrieval” embrace this.GraphRAG: The hottest buzzword of late 2024/2025 is GraphRAG — graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation. By marrying vectors with knowledge graphs, GraphRAG encodes the relationships between entities that embeddings alone flatten away. The payoff is dramatic.Benchmarks and evidenceAmazon’s AI blog cites benchmarks from Lettria, where hybrid GraphRAG boosted answer correctness from ~50% to 80%-plus in test datasets across finance, healthcare, industry, and law.  The GraphRAG-Bench benchmark (released May 2025) provides a rigorous evaluation of GraphRAG vs. vanilla RAG across reasoning tasks, multi-hop queries and domain challenges.  An OpenReview evaluation of RAG vs GraphRAG found that each approach has strengths depending on task — but hybrid combinations often perform best.  FalkorDB’s blog reports that when schema precision matters (structured domains), GraphRAG can outperform vector retrieval by a factor of ~3.4x on certain benchmarks.  The rise of GraphRAG underscores the larger point: Retrieval is not about any single shiny object. It’s about building retrieval systems — layered, hybrid, context-aware pipelines that give LLMs the right information, with the right precision, at the right time.What this means going forwardThe verdict is in: Vector databases were never the miracle. They were a step — an important one — in the evolution of search and retrieval. But they are not, and never were, the endgame.The winners in this space won’t be those who sell vectors as a standalone database. They will be the ones who embed vector search into broader ecosystems — integrating graphs, metadata, rules and context engineering into cohesive platforms.In other words: The unicorn isn’t the vector database. The unicorn is the retrieval stack.Looking ahead: What’s nextUnified data platforms will subsume vector + graph: Expect major DB and cloud vendors to offer integrated retrieval stacks (vector + graph + full-text) as built-in capabilities.“Retrieval engineering” will emerge as a distinct discipline: Just as MLOps matured, so too will practices around embedding tuning, hybrid ranking and graph construction.Meta-models learning to query better: Future LLMs may learn to orchestrate which retrieval method to use per query, dynamically adjusting weighting.Temporal and multimodal GraphRAG: Already, researchers are extending GraphRAG to be time-aware (T-GRAG) and multimodally unified (e.g. connecting images, text, video).Open benchmarks and abstraction layers: Tools like BenchmarkQED (for RAG benchmarking) and GraphRAG-Bench will push the community toward fairer, comparably measured systems.From shiny objects to essential infrastructureThe arc of the vector database story has followed a classic path: A pervasive hype cycle, followed by introspection, correction and maturation. In 2025, vector search is no longer the shiny object everyone pursues blindly — it’s now a critical building block within a more sophisticated, multi-pronged retrieval architecture.The original warnings were right. Pure vector-based hopes often crash on the shoals of precision, relational complexity and enterprise constraints. Yet the technology was never wasted: It forced the industry to rethink retrieval, blending semantic, lexical and relational strategies.If I were to write a sequel in 2027, I suspect it would frame vector databases not as unicorns, but as legacy infrastructure — foundational, but eclipsed by smarter orchestration layers, adaptive retrieval controllers and AI systems that dynamically choose which retrieval tool fits the query.As of now, the real battle is not vector vs keyword — it’s the indirection, blending and discipline in building retrieval pipelines that reliably ground gen AI in facts and domain knowledge. That’s the unicorn we should be chasing now.Amit Verma is head of engineering and AI Labs at Neuron7. Read more from our guest writers. Or, consider submitting a post of your own!
