- [Agent coordination is the missing piece in AI commerce — new AWS and Visa blueprints target the gap](https://venturebeat.com/ai/agent-coordination-is-the-missing-piece-in-ai-commerce-new-aws-and-visa) — 21:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > With some needed infrastructure now being developed for agentic commerce, enterprises will want to figure out how to participate in this new form of buying and selling. But it remains a fragmented Wild West with competing payment protocols, and it's unclear what enterprises need to do to prepare. More cloud providers and AI model companies will start providing enterprises with the tools needed to begin building systems that enable agentic commerce.AWS, which will list Visa’s Intelligence Commerce platform on the AWS Marketplace, believes that making it easier to connect to tools that enable agentic payments would accelerate the adoption of agentic commerce. While this doesn’t mean Amazon has formally adopted Visa’s Trusted Agent Protocol (TAP), which would bring the world’s largest e-commerce platform to the agentic shopping space, it does show just how agentic commerce is fast becoming an area enterprises want to focus on.   Scott Mullins, AWS managing director of Worldwide Financial Services, told VentureBeat in an email that listing the platform “makes payment capabilities accessible” in a secure manner that quickly integrates with Visa’s system. “We’re giving developers pre-built frameworks and standardized infrastructure to eliminate major development barriers,” Mullins said. He added that the idea is to list Visa’s platform to streamline integration with AWS services like Bedrock and AgentCore. In addition to listing the Visa Intelligence Commerce platform on AWS Marketplace, the two companies will also publish blueprints to the public Bedrock AgentCore repository. Mullins said this will “significantly reduce development time and complexity that anyone can use to create travel booking agents, retail shopping agents and B2B payment reconciliation agents.”The Visa Intelligence Commerce platform will be MCP-compatible, allowing enterprises to connect agents running on it to other agents. What enterprises need to know
Through the Visa Intelligence Commerce platform, AWS customers can access authentication, agentic tokenization and data personalization tools. These allow organizations to register and connect their agents to Visa’s payment infrastructure. The platform helps mask credit card details through tokenized digital credentials and lets companies set guidelines for agent transactions, like spending limits. Rubali Birwadker, senior vice president and global head of Growth at Visa, said in a press release that bringing the platform to AWS lets it scale, “helping to unlock faster innovation for developers and better experiences for consumers and businesses worldwide.”Mullins said Visa and AWS are helping provide the foundational infrastructure for developers and businesses to push for agentic commerce projects, but for this to work, developers must coordinate several agents and understand the different needs of industries. “Real-world commerce often requires multiple agents working together,” Mullins said. “The Travel Booking Agent blueprint, for instance, connects flight, hotel, car rental, and train providers to deliver complete travel journeys with integrated payments. Developers need to design coordination patterns for these complex, multi-agent workflows.”Different use cases also have different needs, so enterprises need to plan carefully around existing infrastructure. This is where the MCP connection is vital, since it will enable communication between an organization’s agents to Visa’s platform while maintaining identity and security. 
Blueprints for agentic commerceMullins said the biggest stumbling block for many enterprises experimenting with agentic commerce is the fragmentation of commerce systems, which creates integration challenges. “This collaboration will address these challenges by providing reference architecture blueprints that developers can use as starting points, combined with AWS's cloud infrastructure and Visa's trusted payment network to create a standardized, secure foundation for agentic commerce,” he said.The reference blueprints would give a framework for enterprise developers, solution architects and software vendors to follow when building these new workflows. Mullins said the blueprints are being developed in coordination with Expedia Group, Intuit and the Eurostars Hotel company. The blueprints will work with the Visa Intelligent Commerce MCP server and APIs and will be managed through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. AWS said that its goal is to “enable a foundation for agentic commerce at Scale, where transactions are handled by agents capable of real-time reasoning and coordination.”These blueprints would eventually become composable, reusable workflows for any organization looking to build travel booking agents or retail shopping agents. These don’t have to be consumer-focused agents; there can also be agents buying flights for employees. 
Agentic commerce marches forwardAgentic commerce, where agents do the product searching, cart adding and payments, is fast becoming the next frontier for AI players. Companies like OpenAI and Google have come out with AI-powered shopping tools to make it easier to surface products and for agents to find them. Browsers like OpenAI’s Atlas and Comet from Perplexity also play a role in connecting agents to websites. Retailers like Walmart and Target have also integrated into ChatGPT, so users can ask the chatbot to search for items through chat. One of the biggest problems facing the adoption of agentic commerce revolves around enabling safe, secure transactions. OpenAI and Stripe launched the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) in September, following Google’s announcement of Agent Pay Protocol (AP2) in collaboration with American Express, Mastercard, PayPal, Salesforce and ServiceNow. Visa followed soon after with TAP, which connects to the Visa Intelligent Commerce platform. “The foundation is now in place through this collaboration, but successful agentic commerce requires thoughtful design that considers the specific needs of industry, users and existing systems while leveraging the standardized infrastructure and blueprints now available,” Mullins said.

- [Hybrid cloud security must be rebuilt for an AI war it was never designed to fight](https://venturebeat.com/security/hybrid-cloud-security-reinvented-ai-era) — 08:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > Hybrid cloud security was built before the current era of automated, machine-based cyberattacks that take just milliseconds to execute and minutes to deliver devastating impacts to infrastructure. The architectures and tech stacks every enterprise depends on, from batch-based detection to siloed tools to 15-minute response windows, stood a better chance of defending against attackers moving at human speed. But in a weaponized AI world, those approaches to analyzing threat data don't make sense. The latest survey numbers tell the story. More than half (55%) of organizations suffered cloud breaches in the past year. That’s a 17-point spike, according to Gigamon's 2025 Hybrid Cloud Security Survey. Nearly half of the enterprises polled said their security tools missed the attack entirely. While 82% of enterprises now run hybrid or multi-cloud environments, only 36% express confidence in detecting threats in real time, per Fortinet's 2025 State of Cloud Security Report.Adversaries aren’t wasting any time weaponizing AI to target hybrid cloud vulnerabilities. Organizations now face 1,925 cyberattacks weekly. That’s an increase of 47% in a year. Further, ransomware surged 126% in the first quarter of 2025 alone. The visibility gaps everyone talks about in hybrid environments is where breaches originate. The bottom line is that the security architectures designed for the pre-AI era can't keep pace.But the industry is finally beginning to respond. CrowdStrike, for its part, is providing one vision of cybersecurity reinvention. Today at AWS re:Invent, the company is rolling out real-time Cloud Detection and Response, a platform designed to compress 15-minute response windows down to seconds. But the bigger story is why the entire approach to hybrid cloud security must change, and what that means for CISOs planning their 2026 strategies.Why the old model for hybrid cloud security is failingInitially, hybrid cloud promised the best of both worlds. Every organization could have public cloud agility with on-prem control. The security model that took shape reflected the best practices at the time. The trouble is that those best practices are now introducing vulnerabilities.How bad is it? The majority of security teams struggle to keep up with the threats and workloads. According to recent research: 91% of security leaders admit to making security compromises in their hybrid cloud environments, often trading visibility for speed, accepting siloed tools, and working with degraded data quality.76% report a shortage of cloud security expertise, limiting their ability to deploy and manage comprehensive solutions.Only 17% of organizations can see attackers moving laterally inside their network. That’s one of several blind spots that attackers capitalize on to exploit dwell times to the fullest, install ransomware, do reconnaissance, and lurk until the time is right to launch an attack.70% now view the public cloud as the riskiest environment in their infrastructure, and half are considering moving workloads back on-prem."You can't secure what you can't see," says Mandy Andress, CISO at Elastic. "That's the heart of the two big challenges we see as security practitioners: The complexity and sprawl of an organization's infrastructure, coupled with the rapid pace of technological change."CrowdStrike's Zaitsev diagnosed the root cause: "Everyone assumed this was a one-way trip, lift and shift everything to the cloud. That's not what happened. We're seeing companies pull workloads back on-prem when the economics make sense. The reality? Everyone's going to be hybrid. Five years from now. Ten years. Maybe forever. Security has to deal with that."Weaponized AI is changing the threat calculus fastThe weaponized AI era isn't just accelerating attacks. It’s breaking the fundamental assumptions on which hybrid cloud security was built. The window between patch release and weaponized exploit collapsed from weeks to hours. The majority of adversaries aren't typing commands anymore; they're automating machine-based campaigns that orchestrate agentic AI at a scale and speed that current hybrid cloud tools and human SOC teams can't keep up with.Zaitsev shared threat data from CrowdStrike's mid-year hunting report, which found that cloud intrusions spiked 136% in a year, with roughly 40% of all cloud actor activity coming from Chinese nexus adversaries. This illustrates how quickly the threat landscape can change, and why hybrid cloud security needs to be reinvented for the AI era now.Mike Riemer, SVP and field CISO at Ivanti, has witnessed the timeline collapse. Threat actors now reverse-engineer patches within 72 hours using AI assistance. If enterprises don't patch within that time frame, "they're open to exploit," Riemer told VentureBeat. "That's the new reality."Using previous-generation tools in the current cloud control plane is a dangerous bet. All it takes is a single compromised virtual machine (VM) that no one knows exists. Compromise the control plane, including the APIs that manage cloud resources, and they’ve got keys to spin up, modify or delete thousands of assets across a company’s hybrid environment.The seams between hybrid cloud environments are attack highways where millisecond-long attacks seldom leave any digital exhaust or traces. Many organizations never see weaponized AI attacks coming.  VentureBeat hears that the worst hybrid cloud attacks can only be diagnosed long after the fact, when forensics and analysis are finally completed. Attackers and adversaries are that good at covering their tracks, often relying on living-off-the-land (LotL) tools to evade detection for months, even years in extreme cases. "Enterprises training AI models are concentrating sensitive data in cloud environments, which is gold for adversaries," CrowdStrike's Zaitsev said. "Attackers are using agentic AI to run their campaigns. The traditional SOC workflow — see the alert, triage, investigate for 15 or 20 minutes, take action an hour or a day later —is completely insufficient. You're bringing a knife to a gunfight."The human toll of relying on outdated architectureThe human toll of the hybrid cloud crisis shows up in SOC metrics and burnout. The AI SOC Market Landscape 2025 report found that the average security operations center processes 960 alerts daily. Each takes roughly 70 minutes to investigate properly. Assuming standard SOC staffing levels, there aren't enough hours in the day to get to all those alerts. Futher, at least 40% of alerts, on average, never get touched. The human cost is staggering. A Tines survey of SOC analysts found that 71% are experiencing burnout. Two-thirds say manual grunt work consumes more than half of SOC workers' day. The same percentage are eyeing the exit from their jobs, and, in many extreme cases as some confide to VentureBeat, the industry.Hybrid environments make everything more complicated. Enterprises have different tools for AWS, Azure and on-prem architectures. They have different consoles; often different teams. As for alert correlation across environments? It's manual and often delegated to the most senior SOC team members — if it happens at all. Batch-based detection can't survive the weaponized AI eraHere's what most legacy vendors of hybrid cloud security tools won't openly admit: Cloud security tools are fundamentally flawed and not designed for real-time defense. The majority are batch-based, collecting logs every five, ten or fifteen minutes, processing them through correlation engines, then generating alerts. In a world where adversaries are increasingly executing machine-based attacks in milliseconds, a 15-minute detection delay isn't just a minor setback; it's the difference between stopping an attack and having to investigate a breach.As adversaries weaponize AI to accelerate cloud attacks and move laterally across systems, traditional cloud detection and response (CDR) tools relying on log batch processing are too slow to keep up. These systems can take 15 minutes or more to surface a single detection.CrowdStrike's Zaitsev didn't hedge. Before the company's new tools released today, there was no such thing as real-time cloud detection and prevention, he claimed. "Everyone else is batch-based. Suck down logs every five or 10 minutes, wait for data, import it, correlate it. We've seen competitors take 10 to 15 minutes minimum. That's not detection—that's archaeology."He continued: "It's carrier pigeon versus 5G. The gap between 15 minutes and 15 seconds isn't just about alert quality. It's the difference between getting a notification that something has already happened; now you're doing cleanup, versus actually stopping the attack before the adversary achieves anything. One is incident response. The other is prevention."Reinventing hybrid cloud security must begin with speedCrowdStrike's new real-time Cloud Detection and Response, part of Falcon Cloud Security's unified cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP), is intended to secure every layer of hybrid cloud risk. It is built on three key innovations:Real-time detection engine: Built on event streaming technology pioneered and battle-tested by Falcon Adversary OverWatch, this engine analyzes cloud logs as they stream in. It then applies detections to eliminate latency and false positives.New cloud-specific indicators of attack out of the box: AI and machine learning (ML) correlate what's happening in real time against cloud asset and identity data. That's how the system catches stealthy moves like privilege escalation and CloudShell abuse before attackers can capitalize on them.Automated cloud response actions and workflows: There's a gap in traditional cloud security. Cloud workload protection (CWP) simply stops at the workload. Cloud security posture management (CSPM) shows what could go wrong. But neither protects the control plane at runtime. New workflows built on Falcon Fusion SOAR close that gap, triggering instantly to disrupt adversaries before SOC teams can intervene.CrowdStrike's Cloud Detection and Response integrates with AWS EventBridge, Amazon's real-time serverless event streaming service. Instead of polling for logs on a schedule, the system taps directly into the event stream as things happen. "Anything that calls itself CNAPP that doesn't have real-time cloud detection and response is now obsolete," CrowdStrike CTO Elia Zaitsev said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. By contrast, EventBridge provides a us asynchronous, microservice-based, just-in-time event processing. "We're not waiting five minutes for a bucket of data," he said. But tapping into it is only half the problem. "Can you actually keep up with that firehose? Can you process it fast enough to matter?" Zaitsev asked rhetorically. CrowdStrike claims it can handle 60 million events per second. "This isn't duct tape and a demo."The underlying streaming technology isn't new to CrowdStrike. Falcon Adversary OverWatch has been running stream processing for 15 years to hunt across CrowdStrike's customer base, processing logs in real time rather than waiting for batch cycles to complete.The platform integrates Charlotte AI for automated triage, providing 98% accuracy matching expert managed detection and response (MDR) analysts, cutting 40-plus hours of manual work weekly. When the system detects a control plane compromise, it doesn't wait for human approval. It revokes tokens, kills sessions, boots the attacker and nukes malicious CloudFormation templates, all before the adversary can execute.What this means for the CNAPP marketCloud security is the fastest-growing segment in Gartner's latest forecast, expanding at a 25.9% CAGR through 2028. Precedence Research projects the market will grow from $36 billion in 2024 to $121 billion by 2034. And it's crowded: Palo Alto Networks, Wiz (now absorbed into Google via a $32 billion acquisition), Microsoft, Orca, SentinelOne (to name a few). CrowdStrike already had a seat at the table as a Leader in the 2025 IDC MarketScape for CNAPP for the third consecutive year. Gartner predicts that by 2029, 40% of enterprises that successfully implement zero trust in cloud environments will rely on CNAPP platforms due to their visibility and control.But Zaitsev is making a bigger claim, stating that today's announcement redefines what "complete" means for CNAPP in hybrid environments. "CSPM isn't going away. Cloud workload protection isn't going away. What becomes obsolete is calling something a CNAPP when it lacks real-time cloud detection and response. You're missing the safety net, the thing that catches what gets through proactive defenses. And in hybrid, something always gets through."The unified platform angle matters specifically for hybrid," he said. "Adversaries deliberately hop between environments because they know defenders run different tools, often different teams, for cloud versus on-prem versus identity. Jumping domains is how you shake your tail. Attackers know most organizations can't follow them across the seams. With us, they can't do that anymore."Building hybrid security for the AI eraReinventing hybrid cloud security won't happen overnight. Here's where CISOs should focus:Map your hybrid visibility gaps: Every cloud workload, every on-prem system, every identity traversing between them. If 82% of breaches trace to blind spots, know where yours are before attackers find them.Pressure vendors on detection latency: Ask challenging questions about architecture. If they're running batch-based processing, understand what a 15-minute window means when adversaries move in seconds.Deploy AI triage now: With 40% of alerts going uninvestigated and 71% of analysts burned out, automation isn't a roadmap item; it’s a must-have for a successful deterrence strategy. Look for measurable accuracy rates and real-time savings.Compress patch cycles to 72 hours: AI-assisted reverse engineering has collapsed the exploit window. Monthly patch cycles don't cut it anymore.Architect for permanent hybrid. Stop waiting for cloud migration to simplify security. It won't. Design for complexity as the baseline, not a temporary state. The 54% of enterprises running hybrid models today will still be hybrid tomorrow.The bottom lineHybrid cloud security must be reinvented for the AI era. Previous-generation hybrid cloud security solutions are quickly being eclipsed by weaponized AI attacks, often launched as machine-on-machine intrusion attempts. The evidence is clear: 55% breach rates, 91% of security leaders making compromises they know are dangerous and AI-accelerated attacks that move faster than batch-based detection can respond. Architectures designed for human-speed threats can't protect against machine-speed adversaries."Modern cybersecurity is about differentiating between acceptable and unacceptable risk," says Chaim Mazal, CSO at Gigamon. "Our research shows where CISOs are drawing that line, highlighting the critical importance of visibility into all data-in-motion to secure complex hybrid cloud infrastructure against today's emerging threats. It's clear that current approaches aren't keeping pace, which is why CISOs must reevaluate tool stacks and reprioritize investments and resources to more confidently secure their infrastructure."VentureBeat will be tracking which approaches to hybrid cloud reinvention actually deliver, and which don't, in the months ahead.
