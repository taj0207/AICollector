# Lightfield: A Bold Pivot from Presentation Software to AI-Native CRM

In a surprising turn of events, the founders of Tome, a startup that once boasted 20 million users for its viral presentation app, have launched Lightfield, an AI-native customer relationship management (CRM) platform. This shift marks a significant departure from their original vision, aiming to redefine how businesses manage customer relationships in a landscape dominated by legacy systems like Salesforce and HubSpot.

## The Genesis of Lightfield

Lightfield's journey began with Tome's success as an AI-driven presentation tool, celebrated for its user-friendly design and innovative features. However, co-founder and CEO Keith Peiris recognized that the general-purpose presentation market was saturated and that true differentiation would be challenging. This realization prompted a strategic pivot towards a more specialized tool tailored for sales and customer-facing teams.

Peiris articulated this transition: "To really help people communicate something—anything—we needed more context." The team decided to focus on sales, a domain where they had already garnered significant user interest. This decision led to a year of stealth development, during which they streamlined their workforce and concentrated on building a product that could genuinely address the complexities of customer interactions.

## Redefining CRM Architecture

What sets Lightfield apart from traditional CRMs is its architectural foundation. Unlike Salesforce and HubSpot, which rely on rigid data schemas and manual data entry, Lightfield captures customer interactions in their raw, unstructured form. This allows the platform to maintain a comprehensive record of conversations, emails, and product usage, offering a nuanced understanding of customer relationships.

Peiris explains the advantage: "Traditional CRMs force every interaction through predefined fields, compressing rich conversations into structured entries. We store customer data in its lossless form, capturing significantly more detail and context." This innovative approach enables sales teams to access a complete chronological record of interactions, facilitating better decision-making and follow-up actions.

## Immediate Impact on Sales Teams

Early adopters of Lightfield have reported remarkable improvements in their sales processes. For instance, Tyler Postle, co-founder of Voker.ai, noted that the platform helped him revive over 40 stalled opportunities in just two hours—leads he had neglected for months while using HubSpot. He emphasized that Lightfield transformed him from a "data hygienist" into a closer, significantly reducing response times to prospects.

Similarly, Radu Spineanu, co-founder of Humble Ops, highlighted a feature that addresses the common issue of neglected deals. Lightfield's ability to prompt users about follow-ups has proven invaluable, preventing potential losses and maintaining engagement with prospects.

## A Shift in Startup Behavior

Interestingly, Lightfield's emergence coincides with a broader trend among Y Combinator startups, many of which are eschewing traditional CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot in favor of more modern, AI-native tools. Peiris noted that a significant number of current YC startups are opting for Lightfield, indicating a shift in how early-stage companies approach customer relationship management.

This trend reflects a growing dissatisfaction with the complexity and cost of legacy systems. Many startups begin with spreadsheets and are now looking for a more streamlined solution that integrates seamlessly into their operations. Lightfield aims to fill this gap, positioning itself as a comprehensive platform that can replace multiple point solutions.

## The Challenge of Legacy Systems

As Lightfield seeks to carve out its niche, the question remains: can established players like Salesforce and HubSpot adapt quickly enough to retain their market share? Both companies have introduced AI features, but Peiris argues that their foundational architectures may hinder their ability to compete effectively. Lightfield’s unique approach to data storage and management could provide it with a significant competitive edge.

## Navigating Privacy and Accuracy Concerns

While Lightfield’s innovative architecture offers numerous advantages, it also raises important questions about privacy and data accuracy. Storing complete conversation histories could lead to privacy concerns, and reliance on AI for data extraction introduces the risk of errors. Peiris has addressed these issues directly, emphasizing that the company prioritizes user consent and human oversight in customer interactions.

## Conclusion: The Future of CRM

Lightfield's launch represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of CRM software. By leveraging AI to automate and enhance customer interactions, it challenges the status quo established by legacy systems. As the company aims to become the go-to solution for early-stage startups, it raises broader questions about the role of AI in enterprise software.

The ultimate test for Lightfield will be whether sales teams trust AI-generated insights enough to base their decisions on them. If successful, Lightfield could redefine not just how customer relationships are managed, but also the very architecture of enterprise software itself. As we observe this unfolding narrative, the implications for both startups and established players in the market are profound.
