  > Earlier this year, I decided to level up my travel game and invest in a charger to bring on trips, rather than raiding my desk outlets every time I packed. I needed a multitasker, something that could power my MacBook Air, charge my phone, and accommodate the random USB-A cord I always seem to need […]
- [Why observable AI is the missing SRE layer enterprises need for reliable LLMs](https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-observable-ai-is-the-missing-sre-layer-enterprises-need-for-reliable) — 11:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > As AI systems enter production, reliability and governance can’t depend on wishful thinking. Here’s how observability turns large language models (LLMs) into auditable, trustworthy enterprise systems.Why observability secures the future of enterprise AIThe enterprise race to deploy LLM systems mirrors the early days of cloud adoption. Executives love the promise; compliance demands accountability; engineers just want a paved road.Yet, beneath the excitement, most leaders admit they can’t trace how AI decisions are made, whether they helped the business, or if they broke any rule.Take one Fortune 100 bank that deployed an LLM to classify loan applications. Benchmark accuracy looked stellar. Yet, 6 months later, auditors found that 18% of critical cases were misrouted, without a single alert or trace. The root cause wasn’t bias or bad data. It was invisible. No observability, no accountability.If you can’t observe it, you can’t trust it. And unobserved AI will fail in silence.Visibility isn’t a luxury; it’s the foundation of trust. Without it, AI becomes ungovernable.Start with outcomes, not modelsMost corporate AI projects begin with tech leaders choosing a model and, later, defining success metrics.
That’s backward.Flip the order:Define the outcome first. What’s the measurable business goal?Deflect 15 % of billing callsReduce document review time by 60 %Cut case-handling time by two minutesDesign telemetry around that outcome, not around “accuracy” or “BLEU score.”Select prompts, retrieval methods and models that demonstrably move those KPIs.At one global insurer, for instance, reframing success as “minutes saved per claim” instead of “model precision” turned an isolated pilot into a company-wide roadmap.A 3-layer telemetry model for LLM observabilityJust like microservices rely on logs, metrics and traces, AI systems need a structured observability stack:a) Prompts and context: What went inLog every prompt template, variable and retrieved document.Record model ID, version, latency and token counts (your leading cost indicators).Maintain an auditable redaction log showing what data was masked, when and by which rule.b) Policies and controls: The guardrailsCapture safety-filter outcomes (toxicity, PII), citation presence and rule triggers.Store policy reasons and risk tier for each deployment.Link outputs back to the governing model card for transparency.c) Outcomes and feedback: Did it work?Gather human ratings and edit distances from accepted answers.Track downstream business events, case closed, document approved, issue resolved.Measure the KPI deltas, call time, backlog, reopen rate.All three layers connect through a common trace ID, enabling any decision to be replayed, audited or improved.Diagram © SaiKrishna Koorapati (2025). Created specifically for this article; licensed to VentureBeat for publication.Apply SRE discipline: SLOs and error budgets for AIService reliability engineering (SRE) transformed software operations; now it’s AI’s turn.Define three “golden signals” for every critical workflow:SignalTarget SLOWhen breachedFactuality≥ 95 % verified against source of recordFallback to verified templateSafety≥ 99.9 % pass toxicity/PII filtersQuarantine and human reviewUsefulness≥ 80 % accepted on first passRetrain or rollback prompt/modelIf hallucinations or refusals exceed budget, the system auto-routes to safer prompts or human review just like rerouting traffic during a service outage.This isn’t bureaucracy; it’s reliability applied to reasoning.Build the thin observability layer in two agile sprintsYou don’t need a six-month roadmap, just focus and two short sprints.Sprint 1 (weeks 1-3): FoundationsVersion-controlled prompt registryRedaction middleware tied to policyRequest/response logging with trace IDsBasic evaluations (PII checks, citation presence)Simple human-in-the-loop (HITL) UISprint 2 (weeks 4-6): Guardrails and KPIsOffline test sets (100–300 real examples)Policy gates for factuality and safetyLightweight dashboard tracking SLOs and costAutomated token and latency trackerIn 6 weeks, you’ll have the thin layer that answers 90% of governance and product questions.Make evaluations continuous (and boring)Evaluations shouldn’t be heroic one-offs; they should be routine.Curate test sets from real cases; refresh 10–20 % monthly.Define clear acceptance criteria shared by product and risk teams.Run the suite on every prompt/model/policy change and weekly for drift checks.Publish one unified scorecard each week covering factuality, safety, usefulness and cost.When evals are part of CI/CD, they stop being compliance theater and become operational pulse checks.Apply human oversight where it mattersFull automation is neither realistic nor responsible. High-risk or ambiguous cases should escalate to human review.Route low-confidence or policy-flagged responses to experts.Capture every edit and reason as training data and audit evidence.Feed reviewer feedback back into prompts and policies for continuous improvement.At one health-tech firm, this approach cut false positives by 22 % and produced a retrainable, compliance-ready dataset in weeks.Cost control through design, not hopeLLM costs grow non-linearly. Budgets won’t save you architecture will.Structure prompts so deterministic sections run before generative ones.Compress and rerank context instead of dumping entire documents.Cache frequent queries and memoize tool outputs with TTL.Track latency, throughput and token use per feature.When observability covers tokens and latency, cost becomes a controlled variable, not a surprise.The 90-day playbookWithin 3 months of adopting observable AI principles, enterprises should see:1–2 production AI assists with HITL for edge casesAutomated evaluation suite for pre-deploy and nightly runsWeekly scorecard shared across SRE, product and riskAudit-ready traces linking prompts, policies and outcomesAt a Fortune 100 client, this structure reduced incident time by 40 % and aligned product and compliance roadmaps.Scaling trust through observabilityObservable AI is how you turn AI from experiment to infrastructure.With clear telemetry, SLOs and human feedback loops:Executives gain evidence-backed confidence.Compliance teams get replayable audit chains.Engineers iterate faster and ship safely.Customers experience reliable, explainable AI.Observability isn’t an add-on layer, it’s the foundation for trust at scale.SaiKrishna Koorapati is a software engineering leader.Read more from our guest writers.
