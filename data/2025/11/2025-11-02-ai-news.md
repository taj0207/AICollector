- [Moving past speculation: How deterministic CPUs deliver predictable AI performance](https://venturebeat.com/ai/moving-past-speculation-how-deterministic-cpus-deliver-predictable-ai) — 13:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > For more than three decades, modern CPUs have relied on speculative execution to keep pipelines full. When it emerged in the 1990s, speculation was hailed as a breakthrough — just as pipelining and superscalar execution had been in earlier decades. Each marked a generational leap in microarchitecture. By predicting the outcomes of branches and memory loads, processors could avoid stalls and keep execution units busy. But this architectural shift came at a cost: Wasted energy when predictions failed, increased complexity and vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown. These challenges set the stage for an alternative: A deterministic, time-based execution model. As David Patterson observed in 1980, “A RISC potentially gains in speed merely from a simpler design.” Patterson’s principle of simplicity underpins a new alternative to speculation: A deterministic, time-based execution model."For the first time since speculative execution became the dominant paradigm, a fundamentally new approach has been invented. This breakthrough is embodied in a series of six recently issued U.S. patents, sailing through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Together, they introduce a radically different instruction execution model. Departing sharply from conventional speculative techniques, this novel deterministic framework replaces guesswork with a time-based, latency-tolerant mechanism. Each instruction is assigned a precise execution slot within the pipeline, resulting in a rigorously ordered and predictable flow of execution. This reimagined model redefines how modern processors can handle latency and concurrency with greater efficiency and reliability. A simple time counter is used to deterministically set the exact time of when instructions should be executed in the future. Each instruction is dispatched to an execution queue with a preset execution time based on resolving its data dependencies and availability of resources — read buses, execution units and the write bus to the register file. Each instruction remains queued until its scheduled execution slot arrives. This new deterministic approach may represent the first major architectural challenge to speculation since it became the standard.The architecture extends naturally into matrix computation, with a RISC-V instruction set proposal under community review. Configurable general matrix multiply (GEMM) units, ranging from 8×8 to 64×64, can operate using either register-based or direct-memory acceess (DMA)-fed operands. This flexibility supports a wide range of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. Early analysis suggests scalability that rivals Google’s TPU cores, while maintaining significantly lower cost and power requirements. Rather than a direct comparison with general-purpose CPUs, the more accurate reference point is vector and matrix engines: Traditional CPUs still depend on speculation and branch prediction, whereas this design applies deterministic scheduling directly to GEMM and vector units. This efficiency stems not only from the configurable GEMM blocks but also from the time-based execution model, where instructions are decoded and assigned precise execution slots based on operand readiness and resource availability. Execution is never a random or heuristic choice among many candidates, but a predictable, pre-planned flow that keeps compute resources continuously busy. Planned matrix benchmarks will provide direct comparisons with TPU GEMM implementations, highlighting the ability to deliver datacenter-class performance without datacenter-class overhead.Critics may argue that static scheduling introduces latency into instruction execution. In reality, the latency already exists — waiting on data dependencies or memory fetches. Conventional CPUs attempt to hide it with speculation, but when predictions fail, the resulting pipeline flush introduces delay and wastes power. The time-counter approach acknowledges this latency and fills it deterministically with useful work, avoiding rollbacks. As the first patent notes, instructions retain out-of-order efficiency: “A microprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions enables execution based on predicted timing rather than speculative issue and recovery," with preset execution times but without the overhead of register renaming or speculative comparators.Why speculation stalledSpeculative execution boosts performance by predicting outcomes before they’re known — executing instructions ahead of time and discarding them if the guess was wrong. While this approach can accelerate workloads, it also introduces unpredictability and power inefficiency. Mispredictions inject “No Ops” into the pipeline, stalling progress and wasting energy on work that never completes. These issues are magnified in modern AI and machine learning (ML) workloads, where vector and matrix operations dominate and memory access patterns are irregular. Long fetches, non-cacheable loads and misaligned vectors frequently trigger pipeline flushes in speculative architectures.The result is performance cliffs that vary wildly across datasets and problem sizes, making consistent tuning nearly impossible. Worse still, speculative side effects have exposed vulnerabilities that led to high-profile security exploits. As data intensity grows and memory systems strain, speculation struggles to keep pace — undermining its original promise of seamless acceleration.Time-based execution and deterministic schedulingAt the core of this invention is a vector coprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions. Rather than relying on speculation, instructions are issued only when data dependencies and latency windows are fully known. This eliminates guesswork and costly pipeline flushes while preserving the throughput advantages of out-of-order execution. Architectures built on this patented framework feature deep pipelines — typically spanning 12 stages — combined with wide front ends supporting up to 8-way decode and large reorder buffers exceeding 250 entriesAs illustrated in Figure 1, the architecture mirrors a conventional RISC-V processor at the top level, with instruction fetch and decode stages feeding into execution units. The innovation emerges in the integration of a time counter and register scoreboard, strategically positioned between fetch/decode and the vector execution units. Instead of relying on speculative comparators or register renaming, they utilize a Register Scoreboard and Time Resource Matrix (TRM) to deterministically schedule instructions based on operand readiness and resource availability.  Figure 1: High-level block diagram of deterministic processor. A time counter and scoreboard sit between fetch/decode and vector execution units, ensuring instructions issue only when operands are ready.A typical program running on the deterministic processor begins much like it does on any conventional RISC-V system: Instructions are fetched from memory and decoded to determine whether they are scalar, vector, matrix or custom extensions. The difference emerges at the point of dispatch. Instead of issuing instructions speculatively, the processor employs a cycle-accurate time counter, working with a register scoreboard, to decide exactly when each instruction can be executed. This mechanism provides a deterministic execution contract, ensuring instructions complete at predictable cycles and reducing wasted issue slots.In conjunction with a register scoreboard, the time-resource matrix associates instructions with execution cycles, allowing the processor to plan dispatch deterministically across available resources. The scoreboard tracks operand readiness and hazard information, enabling scheduling without register renaming or speculative comparators. By monitoring dependencies such as read-after-write (RAW) and write-after-read, it ensures hazards are resolved without costly pipeline flushes. As noted in the patent, “in a multi-threaded microprocessor, the time counter and scoreboard permit rescheduling around cache misses, branch flushes, and RAW hazards without speculative rollback.”Once operands are ready, the instruction is dispatched to the appropriate execution unit. Scalar operations use standard artithmetic logic units (ALUs), while vector and matrix instructions execute in wide execution units connected to a large vector register file. Because instructions launch only when conditions are safe, these units stay highly utilized without the wasted work or recovery cycles caused by mis-predicted speculation. The key enabler of this approach is a simple time counter that orchestrates execution according to data readiness and resource availability, ensuring instructions advance only when operands are ready and resources available. The same principle applies to memory operations: The interface predicts latency windows for loads and stores, allowing the processor to fill those slots with independent instructions and keep execution flowing.Programming model differencesFrom the programmer’s perspective, the flow remains familiar — RISC-V code compiles and executes in the usual way. The crucial difference lies in the execution contract: Rather than relying on dynamic speculation to hide latency, the processor guarantees predictable dispatch and completion times. This eliminates the performance cliffs and wasted energy of speculation while still providing the throughput benefits of out-of-order execution. This perspective underscores how deterministic execution preserves the familiar RISC-V programming model while eliminating the unpredictability and wasted effort of speculation. As John Hennessy put it: "It’s stupid to do work in run time that you can do in compile time”— a remark reflecting the foundations of RISC and its forward-looking design philosophy.The RISC-V ISA provides opcodes for custom and extension instructions, including floating-point, DSP, and vector operations. The result is a processor that executes instructions deterministically while retaining the benefits of out-of-order performance. By eliminating speculation, the design simplifies hardware, reduces power consumption and avoids pipeline flushes. These efficiency gains grow even more significant in vector and matrix operations, where wide execution units require consistent utilization to reach peak performance. Vector extensions require wide register files and large execution units, which in speculative processors necessitate expensive register renaming to recover from branch mispredictions. In the deterministic design, vector instructions are executed only after commit, eliminating the need for renaming.Each instruction is scheduled against a cycle-accurate time counter: “The time counter provides a deterministic execution contract, ensuring instructions complete at predictable cycles and reducing wasted issue slots.” The vector register scoreboard resolves data dependency before issuing instructions to execution pipeline.  Instructions are dispatched in a known order at the correct cycle, making execution both predictable and efficient.Vector execution units (integer and floating point) connect directly to a large vector register file. Because instructions are never flushed, there is no renaming overhead. The scoreboard ensures safe access, while the time counter aligns execution with memory readiness. A dedicated memory block predicts the return cycle of loads. Instead of stalling or speculating, the processor schedules independent instructions into latency slots, keeping execution units busy. “A vector coprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions ensures high utilization of wide execution units while avoiding misprediction penalties.”In today’s CPUs, compilers and programmers write code assuming the hardware will dynamically reorder instructions and speculatively execute branches. The hardware handles hazards with register renaming, branch prediction and recovery mechanisms. Programmers benefit from performance, but at the cost of unpredictability and power consumption.In the deterministic time-based architecture, instructions are dispatched only when the time counter indicates their operands will be ready. This means the compiler (or runtime system) doesn’t need to insert guard code for misprediction recovery. Instead, compiler scheduling becomes simpler, as instructions are guaranteed to issue at the correct cycle without rollbacks. For programmers, the ISA remains RISC-V compatible, but deterministic extensions reduce reliance on speculative safety nets.Application in AI and MLIn AI/ML kernels, vector loads and matrix operations often dominate runtime. On a speculative CPU, misaligned or non-cacheable loads can trigger stalls or flushes, starving wide vector and matrix units and wasting energy on discarded work. A deterministic design instead issues these operations with cycle-accurate timing, ensuring high utilization and steady throughput. For programmers, this means fewer performance cliffs and more predictable scaling across problem sizes. And because the patents extend the RISC-V ISA rather than replace it, deterministic processors remain fully compatible with the RVA23 profile and mainstream toolchains such as GCC, LLVM, FreeRTOS, and Zephyr.In practice, the deterministic model doesn’t change how code is written — it remains RISC-V assembly or high-level languages compiled to RISC-V instructions. What changes is the execution contract: Rather than relying on speculative guesswork, programmers can expect predictable latency behavior and higher efficiency without tuning code around microarchitectural quirks.The industry is at an inflection point. AI/ML workloads are dominated by vector and matrix math, where GPUs and TPUs excel — but only by consuming massive power and adding architectural complexity. In contrast, general-purpose CPUs, still tied to speculative execution models, lag behind.A deterministic processor delivers predictable performance across a wide range of workloads, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of task complexity. Eliminating speculative execution enhances energy efficiency and avoids unnecessary computational overhead. Furthermore, deterministic design scales naturally to vector and matrix operations, making it especially well-suited for AI workloads that rely on high-throughput parallelism. This new deterministic approach may represent the next such leap: The first major architectural challenge to speculation since speculation itself became the standard.Will deterministic CPUs replace speculation in mainstream computing? That remains to be seen. But with issued patents, proven novelty and growing pressure from AI workloads, the timing is right for a paradigm shift. Taken together, these advances signal deterministic execution as the next architectural leap — redefining performance and efficiency just as speculation once did.Speculation marked the last revolution in CPU design; determinism may well represent the next.Thang Tran is the founder and CTO of Simplex Micro.Read more from our guest writers.
