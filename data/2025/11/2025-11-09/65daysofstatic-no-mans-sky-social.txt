65daysofstatic is returning to No Man’s Sky with a new album-length score that leans into the game’s procedural universe while challenging what an AI-saturated music landscape should feel like. Expect human-played polyrhythms, glitchy ambience, and generative stems that evolve with the game’s ever-changing planets. Hello Games plans to weave the tracks into upcoming expeditions, so players will hear different motifs as they travel. It is a reminder that live instrumentation and studio experimentation still matter even when algorithms can spit out endless loops.
