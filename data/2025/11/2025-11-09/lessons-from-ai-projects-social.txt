VentureBeat spoke with teams that watched promising AI proofs of concept fall apart before launch. Their takeaways: lock stakeholder expectations early, pair data scientists with domain experts, stress-test infrastructure before pilot hype, and build governance paths for when models drift or underperform. The companies that eventually scaled did not chase bigger models—they invested in documentation, training, and feedback loops so frontline staff could course-correct. Worth a read if your 2025 roadmap still treats AI as magic instead of disciplined engineering.
