A quick retail note for holiday decorators: Hallmark and a wave of independent makers are leaning into nostalgia with ornaments modeled after retro consoles, cult film props, and iconic gadgets. Expect pieces like a talking Xbox 360 miniature or cassette-era callbacks that actually light up, plus crossover collections from pop culture franchises. Limited manufacturing runs mean the best designs will sell through fast, so now is the moment to scope specialty shops, museum stores, and online drops if you want your tree to reflect your favorite eras.
