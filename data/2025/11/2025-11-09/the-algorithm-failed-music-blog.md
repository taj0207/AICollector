It is remarkable how quickly a tool designed to broaden our horizons can shrink them. Terrence O’Brien’s Stepback column, “The algorithm failed music,” is less a takedown of technology than a lament for what happens when engagement metrics become the only compass. Streaming services once promised an infinity of songs; open any app today and you are more likely to encounter a loop of carefully optimized playlists that sound pleasant, familiar, and indistinguishable. The column traces how we arrived at this beige middle and suggests a path back toward discovery that trusts human judgment.

To understand the malaise, we have to revisit the early days of personalized radio. Pandora’s Music Genome Project or Last.fm’s scrobbling system felt magical because they highlighted connective tissue among artists you already loved. As the major platforms matured, however, discovery zones became entangled with growth targets. Playlists like Spotify’s Discover Weekly or Apple Music’s Chill Mix still offer new names, but the selection is constrained by machine learning models trained to minimize skips. Songs that provoke strong reactions—whether love or hate—risk getting sidelined because they jeopardize completion rates. Over time, this bias produces a conveyor belt of mid-tempo tracks calibrated for productivity playlists and mood branding.

O’Brien argues that the problem is not algorithms per se, but the incentives behind them. Recommendation systems are excellent at predicting what will keep the average listener streaming for longer. They are less adept at capturing the messy, localized culture that makes music scenes flourish. Think about how many influential genres emerged from specific communities: Chicago footwork, UK grime, baile funk, Jersey club. These movements thrived because DJs, radio hosts, and independent label owners took chances on material that did not conform to mainstream tastes. When a global platform treats every listener as interchangeable, those edges get sanded down before they can prick the wider audience’s curiosity.

Listeners feel the effects. Many people describe their queues as “samey” even though they have access to catalogues spanning decades and continents. The paradox stems from algorithmic reinforcement. If you half-listen to lo-fi beats while working, the system infers that is all you want, doubling down on similar selections. Without intervention, you rarely stumble onto a fierce jazz improvisation or a blistering punk demo because the data suggests you might skip them. That skip would register as a failure, even though it could spark a conversation or lead you to explore a new scene. The algorithm prioritizes comfort; the column makes a case for friction.

So what does O’Brien recommend? The column champions human curatorship in all its forms. Substack newsletters such as Flow State or indie label dispatches assemble selections with context, pairing tracks with stories that explain why they matter. Community radio stations—whether terrestrial or internet-based—still host DJs who relish the element of surprise. Record stores and listening bars offer the tactile experience of flipping through crates, guided by staff who learn your tastes over time. Even social gatherings, from listening clubs to Discord servers, provide spaces where people argue about music passionately. Those arguments are productive because they expose you to perspectives algorithms cannot predict.

Importantly, reclaiming discovery does not mean abandoning technology. O’Brien notes that listeners can tweak their digital habits to encourage serendipity. Start by following writers, DJs, and small labels on streaming platforms; their public playlists often cut across genres. Use search filters to jump by region or era rather than mood. When a service surfaces an artist you enjoy, dig into their back catalog manually instead of waiting for the algorithm to feed you the next track. These small acts signal that you are open to exploration, nudging the recommendation engine away from complacency.

There is also a cultural dimension tied to how musicians are compensated. The current pro-rata royalty model rewards tracks that receive the most streams, incentivizing labels to chase background listening. If a short, unobtrusive song racks up millions of plays on a focus playlist, it may generate more revenue than a daring seven-minute suite that fans replay obsessively. By seeking out artists directly—buying merch, subscribing to Bandcamp updates, attending shows—listeners can help sustain the ecosystems that algorithms overlook. O’Brien’s column implicitly calls for this recalibration: pay attention to the humans behind the music, not just the interface delivering it.

Critics sometimes counter that algorithmic playlists democratize access, giving independent artists a chance to appear alongside superstars. That can be true, but the wins are often fleeting. Placement on a prominent playlist may spike streams for a week, only for the track to vanish when the rotation updates. Without narrative context, casual listeners rarely remember the artist’s name. Contrast that with a DJ set or a newsletter recommendation, where the curator might explain how a song fits into a scene or why it pairs with a specific mood. The story creates a lasting impression. Algorithms excel at scale; humans excel at meaning.

Perhaps the most compelling part of the Stepback column is its invitation to slow down. Instead of letting autoplay guide your evening, choose an album and listen front to back. Read liner notes. Research who produced the tracks and what inspired them. Share that knowledge with friends. The process transforms listening from passive consumption into active participation. Music has always been social; even solitary listening draws on the labor of countless creators, engineers, and promoters. By honoring that labor, we escape the homogenized soundscape that engagement metrics encourage.

In the end, “The algorithm failed music” is not a doom prophecy. It is a reminder that the tools we built respond to the behavior we reward. If we chase convenience, we will receive infinite loops of inoffensive background sound. If we crave discovery and take deliberate steps to seek it, we can coax both algorithms and communities toward richer experiences. The column closes with optimism rooted in action: subscribe to the tastemakers you trust, wander into record shops, and treat each recommendation as the start of a relationship rather than a fleeting metric. Music deserves nothing less.
