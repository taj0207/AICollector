At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprise leaders gathered to discuss the real impact of AI in business. Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke highlighted that only 11% of companies see measurable benefits from AI, emphasizing a need for context over mere adoption. The event showcased how Celonis is transforming AI implementation through a 'living digital twin' of operations, allowing organizations to unify data and processes effectively. Real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar illustrated the tangible benefits of this approach, proving that AI's true potential lies in its integration with existing workflows. The shift from experimentation to execution is now clearer than ever, marking a pivotal moment for enterprise AI.
