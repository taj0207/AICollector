At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprise leaders gathered to discuss the real impact of AI. Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke revealed that only 11% of companies see measurable benefits from AI projects, emphasizing that the challenge lies in context, not adoption. Celonis showcased its innovative Process Intelligence Graph, which integrates data across systems to create a living model of operations. With real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar, the event highlighted the shift from AI experimentation to outcome-driven operations. The focus is clear: AI must be grounded in the realities of business processes to drive meaningful change.
