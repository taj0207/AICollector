At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprise leaders gathered to discuss the tangible benefits of AI in business. Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke highlighted a critical insight: only 11% of companies are realizing measurable gains from AI, not due to adoption issues, but because of a lack of context. By focusing on process intelligence, Celonis aims to transform AI from mere experimentation into impactful execution. With real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and Uniper, the event showcased how understanding organizational processes can lead to significant productivity increases. This shift marks a pivotal moment for enterprises looking to harness AI effectively, emphasizing that success lies in integrating intelligence with operational realities.
