At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprise leaders gathered to discuss the tangible benefits of AI in business. Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke highlighted that only 11% of companies see measurable gains from AI, emphasizing a need for context over mere adoption. The event showcased how AI can integrate into existing processes, transforming operations into a living digital twin. Real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and Uniper illustrated the power of process intelligence in driving efficiency and cultural change. As organizations shift from pilot projects to outcome-driven operations, the focus is on creating interconnected systems that enhance collaboration and adaptability. This year marked a pivotal moment in making AI a practical tool for enterprises, grounded in the realities of how work actually gets done.
