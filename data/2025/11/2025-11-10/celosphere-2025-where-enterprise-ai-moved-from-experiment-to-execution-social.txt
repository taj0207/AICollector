At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprise leaders gathered to discuss the realities of AI implementation. Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke highlighted that only 11% of companies are seeing measurable benefits from AI, emphasizing a need for context over mere adoption. The event showcased how Celonis is transforming AI from theoretical projects into actionable insights through a 'living digital twin' of operations. With real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and others, the focus shifted from isolated AI pilots to integrated, outcome-driven processes. This marks a pivotal moment in enterprise AI, where understanding and collaboration are key to unlocking true potential.
