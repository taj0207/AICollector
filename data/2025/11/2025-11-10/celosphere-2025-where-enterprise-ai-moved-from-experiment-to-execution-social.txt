At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke revealed a stark reality: only 11% of companies see measurable benefits from AI projects. The issue isn't adoption but context. Celonis showcased how to integrate AI into existing processes, emphasizing the importance of a 'living digital twin' of operations. Real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and others illustrated how process intelligence transforms not just operations but organizational culture. This event marked a pivotal shift in enterprise AI, moving from experimentation to tangible results, with a focus on collaboration and adaptability. The future of AI is not just about technology; it's about understanding and enhancing human processes.
