At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprise leaders gathered to discuss the tangible impacts of AI. Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke highlighted a staggering fact: only 11% of companies are seeing measurable benefits from AI. The focus shifted from mere technology to understanding processes, emphasizing the importance of context. Celonis showcased a 'living digital twin' of operations, uniting disparate data sources into a coherent model. Real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar illustrated how process intelligence can transform operations and culture. This year's event marked a pivotal shift towards actionable AI, grounded in the realities of business. The message was clear: true AI transformation requires a deep understanding of how work gets done, not just the technology itself.
