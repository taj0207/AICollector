At Celosphere 2025, enterprise leaders gathered in Munich to discuss the real impact of AI in business. Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke revealed that only 11% of companies see measurable benefits from AI, highlighting a need for context over mere adoption. The event showcased a shift from experimentation to execution, emphasizing the importance of understanding processes. With innovations like the Process Intelligence Graph, organizations can now integrate AI meaningfully into their operations. Real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and others illustrated how this approach transforms not just processes, but company culture. The future of AI in business is about collaboration and adaptability, grounded in the reality of how work actually gets done.
