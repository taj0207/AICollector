At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprise leaders gathered to discuss the tangible benefits of AI. Co-CEO Alexander Rinke revealed that only 11% of companies see measurable results from AI projects, highlighting a crucial context problem rather than an adoption issue. Celonis showcased its innovative Process Intelligence Graph, which integrates data across systems, allowing organizations to visualize and optimize their operations. Real-world examples from Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar illustrated how process intelligence transforms not only processes but also company culture. This event marked a pivotal shift from AI experimentation to actionable insights, emphasizing that true AI success lies in understanding and enhancing the intricate workflows that drive businesses forward.
