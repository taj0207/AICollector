### How Context Engineering Can Transform Software Development

In the fast-paced world of software development, scaling teams often encounter significant challenges. This was the case for monday.com, a cloud project tracking software company that saw its engineering organization grow to over 500 developers. As the number of product lines and microservices multiplied, the team faced an overwhelming influx of code reviews, leading to potential quality issues. To tackle this, they turned to Qodo, an Israeli startup specializing in AI-driven developer tools.

### The Challenge of Code Review at Scale

As monday.com expanded, the engineering team found itself inundated with thousands of pull requests each month. The traditional methods of code review were no longer sufficient, risking both developer burnout and code quality. Guy Regev, VP of R&D at monday.com, recognized the need for a solution that could streamline this process without compromising on quality. This is where Qodo’s innovative approach came into play.

### What Is Context Engineering?

Qodo’s unique offering lies in its concept of context engineering. Unlike conventional code generation tools, Qodo focuses on reviewing existing code by understanding the nuances of each pull request. It analyzes not just the code changes but also the underlying business logic and internal best practices. This level of context awareness allows Qodo to provide tailored feedback that reflects the specific standards and values of monday.com’s engineering teams.

### Real-World Impact: A Transformative Tool

The integration of Qodo into monday.com’s development workflow proved to be transformative. By leveraging AI to evaluate pull requests, Qodo helped the team catch critical issues that human reviewers might overlook. For instance, it flagged a line of code that inadvertently exposed a staging environment variable—something that could have led to serious security vulnerabilities if not caught in time. This capability has resulted in preventing over 800 issues from reaching production each month, significantly enhancing the overall quality of the software.

### Streamlined Integration and Workflow

One of the standout features of Qodo is its seamless integration into existing development environments. By functioning as a GitHub action, it requires minimal adjustment from developers, allowing them to receive context-aware suggestions during the review process. This human-in-the-loop model ensures that while Qodo provides valuable insights, the final decision-making power remains with the developers.

### Measurable Benefits and Future Prospects

Since implementing Qodo, monday.com has reported substantial time savings across its teams. Developers save an average of an hour per pull request, which, when multiplied across thousands of PRs each month, translates to thousands of hours saved annually. The feedback generated by Qodo is not generic; it is tailored to reflect the company’s specific conventions, making it more likely that developers will act on it.

Looking ahead, monday.com plans to deepen its integration with Qodo, envisioning a future where business context flows directly into the code review process. This alignment of development with business objectives could redefine how software is built and delivered.

### Conclusion

As AI continues to evolve, tools like Qodo demonstrate the importance of context in software development. By providing insights that are both relevant and actionable, Qodo not only enhances the quality of code but also empowers developers to take ownership of their work. As we move toward a future where AI becomes an integral part of the development process, the lessons learned from monday.com and Qodo will be invaluable for companies looking to scale effectively.
