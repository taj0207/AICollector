### How Context Engineering is Revolutionizing Code Review at monday.com

As the engineering organization at monday.com expanded beyond 500 developers, the challenges of managing a rapidly growing codebase became evident. With an increasing number of product lines and microservices, the volume of pull requests surged, creating a bottleneck in the review process. To address this, monday.com turned to Qodo, an innovative AI tool that specializes in context engineering. This partnership has not only streamlined their code review process but also significantly improved code quality and team efficiency.

### The Need for a New Approach

With developers shipping updates across hundreds of repositories, the traditional code review methods were proving inadequate. Pull requests were piling up, and the risk of quality slipping was a genuine concern. Guy Regev, VP of R&D at monday.com, recognized the need for a solution that could handle the volume without overwhelming the team. Qodo emerged as a promising candidate, offering a unique approach to code review that goes beyond mere bug detection.

### What is Context Engineering?

Qodo’s context engineering is a game changer in the realm of software development. Unlike conventional tools that focus solely on identifying errors, Qodo takes a holistic view of each pull request. It analyzes not just the code changes but also the business logic, team conventions, and even historical discussions related to the codebase. This allows Qodo to provide context-aware recommendations that are tailored to the specific needs of the monday.com development teams.

Regev notes that Qodo feels less like a tool and more like an additional team member. It learns from the existing codebase and adapts its feedback accordingly, making it invaluable for maintaining quality standards. For instance, Qodo successfully flagged a potentially dangerous exposure of a staging environment variable that human reviewers had missed, underscoring its effectiveness in catching subtle issues.

### Integration into the Development Workflow

The integration of Qodo into monday.com’s development workflow has been seamless. By embedding Qodo directly into GitHub, developers can receive real-time suggestions during the review process without needing to learn a new tool. This human-in-the-loop model ensures that while Qodo provides valuable insights, the final decision remains with the developers. As a result, the team has reported saving an average of an hour per pull request, which translates to thousands of hours saved annually.

### Looking Ahead: The Future of Developer Tools

The success of Qodo at monday.com has sparked plans for deeper integrations with their developer-focused product line, Monday Dev. The vision is to create a workflow where business context flows directly into the code review process, allowing developers to assess not just the functionality of the code but its alignment with business objectives.

As Qodo continues to evolve, it is positioned to become a cornerstone of modern software development. With its focus on context-aware reviews and its commitment to adapting to team-specific practices, Qodo is setting a new standard for how companies can leverage AI in their development processes. As we look toward the future, the rise of context engines like Qodo could very well redefine the landscape of software engineering, making it more efficient and effective than ever before.
