Baseten, valued at $2.15 billion, is redefining AI training with its new platform, Baseten Training. This infrastructure solution enables companies to fine-tune open-source AI models while retaining control over their model weights. As enterprises seek alternatives to costly closed-source providers like OpenAI, Baseten's approach promises to simplify the training process without the operational headaches of managing GPU clusters. By allowing users to own their model weights and providing seamless multi-cloud GPU orchestration, Baseten aims to empower businesses to innovate without being locked into restrictive contracts. With early adopters reporting significant cost savings and improved performance, Baseten is poised to reshape the AI landscape for enterprises looking to harness the power of custom models effectively.
