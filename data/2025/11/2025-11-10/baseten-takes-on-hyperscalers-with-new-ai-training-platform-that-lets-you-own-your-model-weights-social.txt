Baseten, valued at $2.15 billion, is shifting gears with its new AI training platform, Baseten Training. This innovative infrastructure allows companies to fine-tune open-source AI models while retaining control over their model weights. As enterprises look to reduce reliance on expensive proprietary systems, Baseten's approach offers a solution to the operational headaches of managing GPU clusters and cloud capacity. With features like multi-cloud GPU orchestration and automated checkpointing, Baseten aims to streamline the training process. As open-source models gain traction, this pivot could redefine the AI landscape for businesses seeking customization without the typical constraints of hyperscalers.
