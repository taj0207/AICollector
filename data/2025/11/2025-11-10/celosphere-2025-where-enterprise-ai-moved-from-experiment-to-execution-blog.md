### Celosphere 2025: Transitioning from AI Experimentation to Execution

The recent Celosphere 2025 event in Munich marked a significant turning point for enterprise AI, showcasing a shift from theoretical discussions to practical implementations. With leaders from various industries in attendance, the focus was on understanding how AI can deliver measurable benefits rather than merely discussing its potential.

#### The Context of AI Adoption

Celonis co-founder Alexander Rinke opened the keynote with a striking statistic: only 11% of companies currently experience measurable benefits from their AI initiatives. This, he argued, is not an issue of adoption but rather a problem of context. Many organizations struggle to automate processes they do not fully understand. This insight resonates with anyone who has attempted to integrate AI into large enterprises. Without a clear view of operational workflows, AI efforts can easily falter.

#### The Living Digital Twin

At the heart of Rinke's presentation was the concept of a 'living digital twin' of operations. Celonis has been evolving this idea for years, and at this event, they unveiled how far they have come. The company's Data Core extracts raw data from various source systems, enabling near real-time queries across billions of records. This foundational layer supports the Process Intelligence Graph, a system-agnostic model that unifies data from disparate systems, applications, and even devices. 

This comprehensive approach allows businesses to visualize every transaction and process interaction, creating a continuously updated replica of their operations. The new Build Experience empowers organizations to analyze and design AI-driven processes that deliver real business impact, moving beyond mere technical demonstrations.

#### Real-World Applications

Celosphere featured compelling case studies from companies like Mercedes-Benz and Uniper, illustrating the practical benefits of Celonis’ platform. Mercedes-Benz described how process intelligence became their 'connective tissue' during the semiconductor crisis, enabling them to visualize and act on data from various sources rapidly. This capability not only improved operational efficiency but also fostered a cultural shift within the organization.

Similarly, Uniper demonstrated how process-aware AI copilots are reshaping operations in the energy sector. By predicting maintenance needs for hydropower plants, they are reducing downtime and emissions. These examples highlight how process intelligence can drive not just operational improvements but also cultural transformation within organizations.

#### The Future of Composable AI

Rinke's vision for the future is centered on interoperability and open ecosystems. The event showcased deeper integrations with platforms like Microsoft Fabric and Databricks, allowing organizations to query process data with minimal latency. This approach makes 'composable enterprise AI' a tangible reality, enabling businesses to assemble and govern AI solutions across different ecosystems.

The takeaway is clear: enterprise AI will thrive when systems work together through shared context, rather than being confined to isolated vendor ecosystems. This message resonated strongly with attendees, underscoring the importance of collaboration in today's complex business landscape.

#### A Broader Perspective

The closing moments of the keynote took an unexpected turn when Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado joined via satellite to discuss how data and civic coordination can drive social change. Her words served as a poignant reminder that the principles of transparency and accountability are just as vital in democracy as they are in business.

### Conclusion

Celosphere 2025 highlighted a crucial evolution in how enterprises approach AI—from experimental pilots to grounded, process-driven implementations. As organizations increasingly recognize the importance of context in AI, the focus is shifting toward creating systems that not only automate tasks but also enhance adaptability and continuous improvement. This year marked a pivotal moment in making AI a practical tool for enterprises, grounded in the realities of how work actually gets done.
