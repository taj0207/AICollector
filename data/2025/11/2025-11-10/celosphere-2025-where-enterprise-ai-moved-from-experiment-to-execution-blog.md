### Celosphere 2025: A Turning Point for Enterprise AI

Celosphere 2025 in Munich marked a significant shift in how enterprises approach artificial intelligence. This year, the focus shifted from mere experimentation to real-world execution, as leaders gathered to discuss the tangible impacts of AI on business processes. Celonis co-founder and co-CEO Alexander Rinke set the tone early in his keynote by stating that only 11% of companies are currently seeing measurable benefits from their AI initiatives. This statistic underscores a crucial point: the challenge lies not in adoption but in context.

### Understanding the Context

Many organizations struggle to implement AI effectively because they lack a comprehensive understanding of their internal processes. Rinke emphasized that without a unified view of how work gets done, companies cannot automate effectively. Celonis aims to bridge this gap by providing what Rinke referred to as a “living digital twin” of operations. This innovative approach allows organizations to visualize their processes in real time, enabling them to make informed decisions based on accurate data.

### The Power of Process Intelligence

At the heart of Celonis’ offering is the Process Intelligence Graph, a system-agnostic model that integrates data from various sources, including task-mining data. This model not only captures transactions but also incorporates business context such as KPIs and benchmarks. By doing so, it provides organizations with a continuously updated replica of their operations, allowing them to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

The new Build Experience introduced at the event empowers organizations to analyze, design, and operate AI-driven processes. This shift from discovery-driven pilots to outcome-focused operations marks a new era for enterprise AI. Companies can now integrate AI where it delivers real business impact, rather than merely showcasing technical capabilities.

### Real-World Applications

The event featured compelling case studies from companies like Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar, showcasing how they have successfully leveraged Celonis’ capabilities. Mercedes-Benz, for example, utilized process intelligence to navigate the complexities of the semiconductor crisis. Dr. Jörg Burzer, a board member, noted that the ability to connect disparate data sources allowed them to act swiftly and effectively.

Vinmar’s CEO, Vishal Baid, highlighted how Celonis has become foundational to their automation strategy, achieving a remarkable 40% productivity increase in their order-to-cash process. These examples illustrate that the integration of AI into existing workflows not only enhances efficiency but also fosters a cultural shift within organizations.

### The Future of Composable AI

Looking ahead, Rinke envisions a future where enterprise AI thrives on interoperability. The recent announcements regarding deeper integrations with platforms like Microsoft Fabric and Databricks signal a move towards composable AI solutions. This approach allows organizations to assemble and govern AI applications across various ecosystems, reducing dependency on any single vendor.

### A Broader Perspective

The keynote also took a poignant turn when Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado joined via satellite to discuss the role of data in democracy. Her insights served as a reminder that the principles of transparency and accountability are just as vital in governance as they are in business.

### Conclusion

Celosphere 2025 has set a new standard for how enterprises can harness AI. By grounding AI initiatives in process intelligence, organizations can not only automate but also adapt and innovate continuously. As Rinke aptly put it, the goal is not just to automate steps but to build enterprises capable of thriving in an ever-changing landscape.
