### Celosphere 2025: A Turning Point for Enterprise AI

The Celosphere 2025 event in Munich marked a significant shift in how enterprises are approaching artificial intelligence. As leaders from various sectors gathered, the conversation moved beyond the usual rhetoric of AI transformation to focus on tangible results. Celonis co-founder and co-CEO Alexander Rinke set the tone early in his keynote, revealing a startling statistic: only 11% of companies are currently realizing measurable benefits from their AI initiatives. This isn’t merely an adoption issue; it’s a contextual one.

### The Contextual Challenge

Rinke's assertion resonates with anyone who has attempted to deploy AI within a large organization. The crux of the problem lies in understanding the intricate processes that drive business operations. Without a unified view of how work is done, companies struggle to automate effectively. Celonis aims to bridge this gap by providing a framework that integrates AI into existing processes rather than treating it as a standalone solution.

### A Living Digital Twin

At the heart of Celonis' offering is what Rinke describes as a 'living digital twin' of operations. This concept has evolved significantly, allowing organizations to free their processes from the constraints of legacy systems. The Data Core infrastructure extracts raw data from various sources, enabling near real-time querying of billions of records. This foundational layer supports the Process Intelligence Graph, a system-agnostic model that unifies data across disparate systems, applications, and devices. By combining operational data with business context—such as KPIs and rules—Celonis provides a continuously updated view of organizational processes.

### From Discovery to Outcome

The event also introduced the new Build Experience, which empowers organizations to analyze, design, and operate AI-driven processes. This shift emphasizes outcome-driven AI operations rather than mere discovery-driven pilots. Companies can now identify bottlenecks, design future states, and orchestrate human and AI interactions seamlessly. This approach reflects a broader trend toward integrating AI into the fabric of business operations, moving away from isolated experiments.

### Real-World Applications

Celosphere featured compelling case studies from companies like Mercedes-Benz, Vinmar, and Uniper, showcasing the practical impact of Celonis' platform. Mercedes-Benz, for instance, highlighted how process intelligence became essential during the semiconductor crisis, enabling them to connect disparate data sources quickly. Vinmar's CEO described Celonis as the backbone of their automation strategy, achieving a 40% productivity lift in their order-to-cash process. Uniper demonstrated how process-aware AI can predict maintenance needs, thereby reducing downtime and emissions.

### The Future of Composable AI

Rinke’s vision for the future is one of openness and interoperability. The emphasis is on creating composable AI solutions that can work across various ecosystems, allowing organizations to build and govern AI applications without being locked into a single vendor. This approach not only enhances flexibility but also ensures that AI can adapt to the unique needs of each business.

### A Broader Perspective

The closing moments of the keynote took an unexpected turn when Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado joined via satellite. She shared how her movement used data and civic coordination to expose election fraud, drawing parallels between the principles of transparency and accountability in both business and democracy. Her poignant remarks served as a reminder that the context surrounding technology is as important as the technology itself.

### Conclusion

Celosphere 2025 was not just about showcasing new technologies; it represented a philosophical shift in how enterprises can leverage AI. By grounding AI in the realities of organizational processes, companies can unlock its true potential. As Rinke aptly put it, 'We’re not just automating steps; we’re building enterprises that can adapt instantly, innovate freely, and improve continuously.' This event marks a pivotal moment in the journey toward effective AI integration in the enterprise landscape.
