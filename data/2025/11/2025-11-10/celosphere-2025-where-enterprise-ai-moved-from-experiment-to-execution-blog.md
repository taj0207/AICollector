# Celosphere 2025: From Experimentation to Execution in Enterprise AI

The landscape of enterprise AI is evolving rapidly, and at Celosphere 2025 in Munich, industry leaders gathered to explore this transformation. The event, hosted by Celonis, marked a significant shift from theoretical applications of AI to practical implementations that yield measurable results. As organizations grapple with the complexities of AI integration, the insights shared at Celosphere offer a roadmap for success.

## The Contextual Challenge of AI Adoption

In his keynote address, Celonis co-founder and co-CEO Alexander Rinke set a sobering tone: only 11% of companies are currently seeing measurable benefits from their AI initiatives. This statistic underscores a critical issue that many organizations face—not a problem of adoption, but rather a problem of context. Rinke emphasized that without a clear understanding of how work is conducted within an organization, effective automation becomes nearly impossible. This sentiment resonates with anyone who has attempted to implement AI in a large enterprise, where siloed data and processes often hinder progress.

## The Concept of a Living Digital Twin

Central to Celonis’ vision is the idea of a “living digital twin” of operations. This concept has been in development for years, but Celosphere 2025 marked a pivotal moment in its evolution. Rinke explained that the journey begins with freeing processes from the constraints of legacy systems. Celonis’ Data Core serves as the backbone, extracting raw data from various sources and enabling real-time querying of billions of records. This foundational layer is crucial for achieving a unified view of organizational processes.

The Process Intelligence Graph, a key feature of the Celonis platform, integrates data from disparate systems, applications, and devices. By combining this data with business context—such as KPIs and benchmarks—organizations can create a continuously updated replica of their operations. This holistic view allows for deeper insights into how processes function and where improvements can be made.

## Shifting to Outcome-Driven AI Operations

Celonis is shifting the narrative from discovery-driven AI pilots to outcome-driven AI operations. The new Build Experience enables organizations to analyze, design, and operate AI-driven processes that integrate intelligence where it matters most. This approach is not merely about technical demonstrations; it’s about creating real business value.

The event showcased several real-world applications of this philosophy. Mercedes-Benz, for instance, illustrated how process intelligence became essential during the semiconductor crisis. By connecting data from various sources, they were able to act swiftly and effectively. Dr. Jörg Burzer, a board member at Mercedes-Benz, noted that this integration not only transformed processes but also fostered a cultural shift within the organization. 

Similarly, Vinmar’s CEO, Vishal Baid, described how Celonis serves as the foundation of their automation strategy, achieving significant productivity gains. Their focus is now on tackling complex challenges that arise in everyday operations, highlighting the ongoing journey toward AI maturity.

## The Promise of Composable Enterprise AI

One of the most exciting developments presented at Celosphere was the concept of composable enterprise AI. Rinke articulated a vision for an open ecosystem where various AI agents can collaborate seamlessly. This approach allows organizations to assemble and govern AI solutions across different platforms without being locked into a single vendor.

The implications of this shift are profound. As companies increasingly rely on a mix of cloud platforms, ERPs, and data tools, the ability to integrate and orchestrate AI across these systems becomes essential for survival. Rinke’s assertion that “good things grow from open ecosystems” resonates deeply in a world where agility and adaptability are paramount.

## A Broader Perspective: Data, Democracy, and Responsibility

The closing moments of the keynote took an unexpected yet poignant turn when Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado joined via satellite. She shared how her movement utilized data and technology to expose election fraud and mobilize citizens. This powerful contrast highlighted the universal need for transparency and accountability, whether in business or governance. 

Machado’s remarks served as a reminder that the principles of context and responsibility are not just technical considerations but are fundamentally human. 

## Conclusion: A New Era for AI in Enterprises

Celosphere 2025 marks a significant turning point in how enterprises approach AI. The emphasis on process intelligence and the integration of AI into operational realities signify a move away from mere experimentation toward actionable results. As organizations learn to navigate the complexities of AI, the insights shared at this event provide a valuable framework for achieving success. Rinke’s closing words encapsulate this vision: “We’re not just automating steps; we’re building enterprises that can adapt instantly, innovate freely, and improve continuously.” In this new era, the intersection of AI and human understanding will be crucial for driving meaningful change.
