### Celosphere 2025: A Turning Point for Enterprise AI

This year’s Celosphere in Munich marked a significant evolution in how enterprises approach artificial intelligence. With the theme of moving from experimentation to execution, leaders gathered to share insights and real-world applications of AI that go beyond mere buzzwords.

#### The Context of AI Transformation

Celonis co-founder and co-CEO Alexander Rinke opened the event with a striking statistic: only 11% of companies are realizing measurable benefits from their AI initiatives. This isn’t a failure of adoption but rather a failure to understand the context in which AI operates. Many organizations struggle to automate processes they don’t fully comprehend. Rinke emphasized that without a clear picture of how work is conducted, AI efforts are likely to falter.

#### A Living Digital Twin of Operations

At the heart of Celonis’ presentation was the concept of a “living digital twin” of an organization’s operations. This innovative model aims to free processes from the constraints of legacy systems. Celonis’ Data Core allows for the extraction of raw data from various sources, providing near real-time insights that extend beyond traditional systems. The Process Intelligence Graph, a system-agnostic model, unifies data across different platforms, capturing everything from task-mining data to business rules and KPIs. This comprehensive approach allows organizations to visualize their operations in a way that was previously unattainable.

#### Real-World Applications

The event featured compelling case studies from companies like Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar, showcasing how process intelligence has become a vital component of their operational strategies. Mercedes-Benz described how Celonis helped them connect disparate data during the semiconductor crisis, turning chaos into clarity. Dr. Jörg Burzer from Mercedes-Benz noted that showing data in context not only transformed processes but also the culture within the organization.

Vinmar’s CEO Vishal Baid shared insights into how the company automated its order-to-cash process, achieving a remarkable 40% productivity increase. He emphasized the importance of tackling complex challenges, such as matching purchase and sales orders, with intelligent AI solutions.

#### The Future of Composable Enterprise AI

Celosphere 2025 also marked a shift towards interoperability in enterprise AI. Rinke articulated a vision for an open ecosystem where various AI agents can collaborate rather than compete. This approach allows organizations to assemble AI solutions that are not tied to a single vendor, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

#### A Broader Perspective

The keynote took an unexpected turn when Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado joined via satellite to discuss the role of data and technology in democracy. Her message resonated deeply, illustrating that the principles of transparency and accountability are as vital in governance as they are in business.

#### Conclusion: A New Era for AI

Celosphere 2025 was more than just a showcase of technology; it was a philosophical shift in how enterprises view AI. The emphasis on process intelligence and contextual understanding signals a new era where AI can truly deliver value. As Rinke aptly put it, the goal is not merely to automate tasks but to build organizations capable of adapting and innovating continuously. This year’s event sets the stage for a future where AI is not just a tool but a fundamental part of how businesses operate and evolve.
