### Celosphere 2025: A Turning Point for Enterprise AI

The recent Celosphere 2025 event in Munich marked a significant shift in the landscape of enterprise AI. Co-founder and co-CEO of Celonis, Alexander Rinke, set the stage with a stark observation: only 11% of companies are currently realizing measurable benefits from their AI initiatives. This isn’t merely a matter of adoption; it’s fundamentally about context. In a world where AI is often touted as a panacea, understanding how it fits into the existing workflows of an organization is crucial.

### The Living Digital Twin

Rinke introduced the concept of a 'living digital twin' of operations, a model that Celonis has been developing for years. This approach aims to free processes from the constraints of legacy systems, allowing organizations to gain a clearer view of their operations. Celonis’ Data Core can query vast amounts of data in real time, creating a comprehensive picture of how work actually gets done. This is where the Process Intelligence Graph comes into play, unifying data across various systems and applications, and integrating essential business context.

### From Discovery to Outcome

One of the most exciting developments showcased at Celosphere was the new Build Experience. This tool allows organizations to analyze, design, and operate AI-driven processes effectively. Rather than merely running AI pilots, companies are now encouraged to focus on outcomes. This shift from discovery-driven initiatives to outcome-driven operations represents a significant evolution in how enterprises can leverage AI.

### Real-World Applications

The event featured compelling case studies from companies like Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar. Mercedes-Benz discussed how process intelligence became essential during the semiconductor crisis, helping them connect disparate data sources quickly. This integration not only improved operational efficiency but also fostered a cultural shift within the organization. Similarly, Vinmar’s CEO highlighted how Celonis serves as the backbone of their automation strategy, achieving remarkable productivity gains.

### The Future of Composable AI

Rinke’s vision for the future of enterprise AI is one of openness and interoperability. By integrating with platforms like Microsoft Fabric and Databricks, Celonis is paving the way for what they term 'composable enterprise AI.' This approach allows organizations to assemble AI solutions tailored to their unique needs, rather than being locked into a single vendor’s ecosystem. The emphasis on collaboration among various AI agents is a refreshing perspective that could redefine how businesses approach technology.

### A Broader Perspective

In an unexpected yet powerful moment, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado joined the keynote via satellite. She shared how her movement used data and technology to expose election fraud. This poignant reminder underscored the importance of context, not just in business but in broader societal issues. 

### Conclusion

Celosphere 2025 was more than just a showcase of technology; it was a philosophical shift in how enterprises approach AI. The focus on grounding AI in real-world processes and human collaboration is a lesson that resonates deeply. As Rinke aptly put it, the goal isn’t merely to automate steps but to build adaptable enterprises that can innovate and improve continuously. This event has set a new benchmark for what enterprise AI can achieve, moving from mere experimentation to genuine execution.
