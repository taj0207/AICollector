### Celosphere 2025: Transforming AI from Experimentation to Execution

The recent Celosphere 2025 event in Munich marked a pivotal moment in the enterprise AI landscape. As leaders gathered to discuss the tangible outcomes of AI initiatives, Celonis co-founder and co-CEO Alexander Rinke made a striking observation: only 11% of companies are currently experiencing measurable benefits from their AI projects. This statistic underscores a critical issue; it’s not about the adoption of AI technologies but rather about understanding the context in which they operate.

### The Context Problem

Rinke's keynote set the tone for the event, emphasizing that many organizations still lack a unified understanding of their internal processes. This gap hinders effective AI implementation. Celonis aims to bridge this divide by focusing on how AI can be seamlessly integrated into the complex, dynamic processes that drive business operations. The concept of achieving a “Return on AI” (ROAI) was central to the discussions, highlighting the necessity of grounding AI initiatives in real-world business contexts.

### A Living Digital Twin

At the heart of Celonis' approach is the innovative Process Intelligence Graph, which Rinke described as a “living digital twin” of an organization’s operations. This model is designed to free processes from the constraints of legacy systems, allowing for real-time data extraction and analysis. The Data Core infrastructure enables organizations to query vast amounts of data, providing insights that extend beyond traditional systems of record.

The Process Intelligence Graph unifies data from various sources, including task-mining data that captures user interactions across different platforms. By combining this data with business context—such as KPIs and business rules—Celonis creates a continuously updated replica of how an organization operates. This comprehensive view is essential for identifying areas for improvement and innovation.

### Real-World Applications

The event showcased real-world applications of the Celonis platform, featuring success stories from companies like Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar. Mercedes-Benz highlighted how process intelligence acted as their “connective tissue” during the semiconductor crisis, enabling them to visualize and act on data scattered across various departments. This integration not only improved operational efficiency but also fostered a cultural shift within the organization.

Vinmar's CEO, Vishal Baid, shared insights on how Celonis has become the foundation of their automation and AI strategy, leading to significant productivity gains. The focus on tackling complex, non-algorithmic challenges illustrates the evolving role of AI in enhancing operational effectiveness.

### The Future of Composable AI

Celosphere 2025 also marked a shift towards interoperability and composability in enterprise AI. Rinke’s vision emphasizes the importance of open ecosystems, allowing organizations to integrate AI solutions across various platforms without being tied to a single vendor. This approach not only enhances flexibility but also ensures that AI technologies can work together harmoniously, reflecting the true nature of business operations.

### A Broader Perspective

In a surprising turn, the event featured Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who spoke about using data and technology for civic coordination and transparency. Her remarks served as a powerful reminder that the principles of context and accountability are not only relevant in business but also in broader societal contexts.

### Conclusion

Celosphere 2025 was a landmark event that signaled a shift in how enterprises approach AI. By moving from experimentation to a focus on measurable outcomes grounded in process intelligence, organizations can build systems that adapt, innovate, and improve continuously. As Rinke succinctly put it, the goal is not just to automate processes but to create enterprises that are agile and responsive to change.
