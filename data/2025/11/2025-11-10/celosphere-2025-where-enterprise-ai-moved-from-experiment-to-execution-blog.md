### Celosphere 2025: A Turning Point for Enterprise AI

This year’s Celosphere in Munich marked a significant shift in the enterprise AI landscape, moving from theoretical discussions to practical applications. Celonis co-founder and co-CEO Alexander Rinke set the stage with a striking statistic: only 11% of companies are currently seeing measurable benefits from their AI initiatives. This revelation underscores a critical issue: it’s not about the adoption of AI technologies but rather the context in which they are applied.

### Understanding the Context of AI

Rinke emphasized that without a comprehensive understanding of how work is conducted within organizations, automating processes becomes nearly impossible. Celonis has been at the forefront of addressing this challenge, presenting a framework that prioritizes process context over mere technological advancements. The concept of a “Return on AI (ROAI)” was introduced, suggesting that real impact can only be achieved when AI is integrated into the intricate processes that drive business.

### The Living Digital Twin

At the heart of Celonis’ offerings is what Rinke referred to as a “living digital twin of your operations.” This concept has evolved significantly, enabling organizations to free their processes from the constraints of legacy systems. The Data Core infrastructure allows for the extraction of raw data from various sources, providing near real-time insights. This is complemented by the Process Intelligence Graph, a system-agnostic model that unifies data across multiple platforms, capturing not just transactional data but also business context, including KPIs and operational rules.

### Practical Applications: Case Studies

The event featured compelling case studies from companies like Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar, showcasing how process intelligence has become a vital component of their operations. Mercedes-Benz, for instance, utilized Celonis to navigate the complexities of the semiconductor crisis by connecting disparate data sources across their supply chain. Dr. Jörg Burzer from Mercedes-Benz noted that the ability to visualize data in context not only transformed processes but also fostered a cultural shift within the organization.

Vinmar’s CEO, Vishal Baid, highlighted how Celonis serves as the backbone of their automation strategy, achieving a remarkable 40% productivity increase in their order-to-cash process. The focus is now on tackling more complex challenges, such as intelligently matching purchase and sales orders.

### The Future of Composable AI

Celonis is also paving the way for “composable enterprise AI,” enabling organizations to build and govern AI solutions across various ecosystems rather than being tied to a single vendor. This approach fosters collaboration among different AI agents, ensuring they work together seamlessly to enhance business operations.

### Beyond Business: A Broader Perspective

The keynote concluded with a poignant moment as Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado joined via satellite to discuss the role of data and technology in democracy. Her insights served as a powerful reminder that the principles of transparency and accountability are as crucial in governance as they are in business.

### Conclusion

Celosphere 2025 was more than just an event; it represented a philosophical shift in how enterprises approach AI. The focus has transitioned from mere experimentation to actionable insights grounded in process intelligence. As Rinke aptly stated, the goal is not just to automate tasks but to create adaptable enterprises that can innovate and improve continuously. This year’s event has set the stage for a future where AI is not just a tool but a transformative force in business.
