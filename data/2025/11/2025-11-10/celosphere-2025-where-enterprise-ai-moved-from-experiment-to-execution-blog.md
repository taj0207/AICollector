### Celosphere 2025: A Turning Point for Enterprise AI

The recent Celosphere 2025 event in Munich marked a significant moment for enterprise AI, shifting the conversation from theoretical discussions to practical applications. Co-founder and co-CEO of Celonis, Alexander Rinke, set the stage with a striking statistic: only 11% of companies currently experience measurable benefits from their AI initiatives. This isn't merely a matter of adoption; it's a context problem, one that many organizations grapple with as they attempt to harness AI's potential.

### The Challenge of Context

For many enterprises, the challenge lies in understanding their internal processes. Rinke emphasized that you cannot automate what you do not comprehend. Most organizations still lack a unified view of their operations, which is essential for effective AI deployment. Celonis aims to bridge this gap by providing a “living digital twin” of operations, allowing companies to visualize and optimize their workflows.

### The Celonis Approach

Central to Celonis' strategy is its Process Intelligence Graph, a system-agnostic model that integrates data from various sources, including task-mining data. This comprehensive approach enables organizations to analyze where processes stall and design future states with AI touchpoints. The new Build Experience allows companies to operate AI-driven processes in a way that delivers real business impact, moving away from discovery-driven pilots to outcome-focused operations.

### Real-World Applications

The event showcased compelling case studies from companies like Mercedes-Benz and Vinmar. Mercedes-Benz described how process intelligence became essential during the semiconductor crisis, enabling them to connect disparate data sources quickly. This integration not only improved operational efficiency but also fostered a cultural shift within the organization. Vinmar, on the other hand, highlighted how they automated their entire order-to-cash process, achieving a remarkable 40% productivity increase. Both examples illustrate the transformative power of process intelligence, not just for operations but for organizational culture as well.

### The Future of AI in Business

As the event progressed, Rinke's vision for the future became clear: enterprise AI must thrive in open ecosystems. By fostering deeper integrations with platforms like Microsoft Fabric and Databricks, Celonis aims to enable organizations to assemble AI solutions that are not confined to a single vendor. This composability is crucial for businesses navigating a landscape filled with various cloud platforms and data tools.

### A Broader Perspective

The keynote took an unexpected turn when Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado joined via satellite to discuss how her movement used data and technology for civic engagement. Her remarks served as a poignant reminder that the principles of transparency and accountability apply not only in business but also in democracy. In both realms, context is key.

### Conclusion

Celosphere 2025 was more than just an event; it was a clarion call for enterprises to rethink their approach to AI. The emphasis on process intelligence and the integration of AI within existing workflows signify a maturation of the technology. As Rinke aptly put it, the goal is not merely to automate tasks but to build adaptable enterprises that can innovate and improve continuously. This shift from experimentation to actionable insights could very well define the future of enterprise AI.
