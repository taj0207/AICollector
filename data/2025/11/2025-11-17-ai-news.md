- [Microsoft’s Agent 365 shifts AI agents from sandbox tools to enterprise-grade infrastructure](https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsofts-agent-365-shifts-ai-agents-from-sandbox-tools-to-enterprise-grade) — 21:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > Managing and maintaining AI systems remains a challenge for many enterprises, particularly with the potential for agentic sprawl to expose businesses to risky entry points. Microsoft entered the observability fray with the launch of Agent 365 during its annual Ignite conference Tuesday. It described Agent 365 as the control plane for AI agents, serving as an observability layer for enterprises running any agent. The company said the platform “delivers unified observability” through telemetry, dashboards, and alerts to track every agent in use.Agent 365 supports any agents, whether built on Microsoft’s platforms or from third parties, including Adobe, Databricks, Cognition, and ServiceNow. “Agent 365 marks a new chapter in how organizations build, secure, and scale their agents. This is a shift from isolated experiments to enterprise readiness, where agents operate as part of a unified, governed, and productive system,” said Microsoft's president of business apps and agents, Charles Lamanna, in a blog post. What enterprises getMicrosoft 365 has five capabilities: registry, access control, visualization, interoperability, and security.  The first step in beginning observability tasks in Microsoft 365 is to log the agents that may be present, which will serve as a single source of truth. The company calls this registry Entra.“This single registry tracks the agents for every relevant role within your organization — IT, developers, security, and business leaders. And with the Agent Store, users can easily discover the right agents for their role and workflows directly within Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams,” Microsoft said. Access Control would require agents to have a unique agent ID, allowing enterprise admins to limit access as needed. Organizations can set policies that agents must adhere to, and the tool can respond by blocking misbehaving agents. Agent 365 also offers a visual dashboard, allowing companies to see how their agents are connected, performance measurements, and task adherence. For enterprises already dealing with agent sprawl, Microsoft’s approach stands out because it bundles what’s usually a patchwork of add-on tools into a single, governed control plane. Most observability options today are either siloed features or separate platforms that add more complexity. Agent 365 treats agents as parts of the stack, giving IT and security teams unified oversight at a moment when that’s becoming essential.Companies like DataDog, Dynatrace and Splunk offer observability services for AI systems. The startup Chronosphere released capabilities similar to observability, focusing on debugging issues, and Raindrop also introduced its own observability tools for performance. Google also began offering an observability dashboard on its AI Agent Builder.  “As agents multiply in numbers and sophistication, companies face a new kind of challenge: how to manage and govern agents responsibly and at scale, without rebuilding the trusted systems they rely on,” Lamanna said. “The clearest path forward is to manage agents the way you manage people, using the same infrastructure, apps, and protections that power your business today.”
- [Google Antigravity introduces agent-first architecture for asynchronous, verifiable coding workflows](https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-antigravity-introduces-agent-first-architecture-for-asynchronous) — 21:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > Google launched yet another coding agent platform Tuesday, this time focused on developer teams collaborating to create agents that can execute complex tasks automatically, in a way that moves agents from being remotely controlled to actually independent.The platform, called Antigravity, is powered by Gemini 3 and is now available in public preview with “generous rate limits on Gemini 3 Pro usage,” Google writes in a blog post accompanying the announcement. Antigravity is an agentic coding platform that aims to evolve the IDE toward an agent-first future with browser control capabilities, asynchronous interaction patterns, and an agent-first product design.Enterprises that are already bogged down by a growing volume of code to review, thanks in large part to the rise of AI code generation, are demanding more from asynchronous coding agents. They need asynchronous coding agents to help developers review coding projects, assess the elements, and perform tasks autonomously. For the public preview, Antigravity users can build agents using Gemini 3, Anthropic’s Sonnet 4.5 models, and OpenAI’s open-source gpt-oss. It will be compatible with developer environments running on major operating systems such as macOS, Linux and Windows. “We want Antigravity to be the home base for software development in the era of agents,” Google writes in the blog. “Our vision is to ultimately enable anyone with an idea to experience liftoff and build that idea into reality.”Google said it built Antigravity with four key tenets — trust, autonomy, feedback, and self-improvement — which it says sets it apart from other coding platforms because it focuses on a more collaborative development environment.Key tenets of developmentEnterprises today are either completely transparent about what's happening under the hood, or they don't show their work and simply split out code. The Antigravity team doesn't think either of these two extremes build trust. "Antigravity provides context on agentic work at a more natural task-level abstraction, with the necessary and sufficient set of artifacts and verification results, for the user to gain that trust. There is a concerted emphasis for the agent to thoroughly think through verification of its work, not just the work itself," according to Google.As for autonomy, Antigravity’s main interface, Editor View, mimics an IDE experience, standardizing what an agent might encounter while accomplishing its tasks. The agent is embedded in this interface so it can navigate it. However, Google plans to add “an agent-first Manager surface” that flips that idea around, meaning the interface is embedded into the agent. The Antigravity team built user feedback into “across every surface or artifact,” which will be automatically incorporated into agent execution. This would allow work to continue without requiring humans to stop the work to redirect the agent. With the human developer iterating with the agent, "self-improvement" becomes very essential. Its agent can tap a knowledge base to learn from past work or contribute new learnings. Google’s many coding agentsAntigravity is not Google’s only coding platform; it’s not even its only coding agent with an IDE integration or asynchronous capabilities. It joins a long line of Google platforms aimed at helping developers work more efficiently. The coding assistant Jules is now integrated into IDEs, can be invoked via the CLI, and can also run asynchronously. Gemini CLI also works similarly. And there's Gemini Code Assist, which first launched last year. However, Antigravity will most likely have to compete more with coding agent platforms like Codex from OpenAI, Claude Code from Anthropic, and Cursor. Some people on X commented that Antigravity looks similar to Windsurf, which would make sense: Google hired the Windsurf team — including CEO Varun Mohan — in July and licensed the tech for $2.4 billion. Varun Mohan tweeted that this came from his team:So far, early Antigravity users have had mixed experiences, with many pointing to errors and slow generation. Editors note: This story was updated on November 18, 2025, to include more information.
