# Fetch AI Launches ASI:One and Business Tier: A New Era for AI Agents

In a significant move for the future of artificial intelligence, Fetch AI, a startup led by Humayun Sheikh, has launched three interconnected products designed to reshape how AI agents operate in the digital landscape. This launch marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI, transitioning from mere information retrieval to actionable task execution.

## The Vision Behind Fetch AI
Founded in 2017, Fetch AI has roots tied to DeepMind, where Sheikh was an early investor and contributor. His experiences there shaped his vision for creating an infrastructure that supports autonomous software agents capable of reliable, multi-step actions. Sheikh's foresight into the potential of agentic systems has culminated in the launch of ASI:One, Fetch Business, and Agentverse, collectively termed the “Agentic Web.” This ecosystem is designed to enable consumer AIs to collaborate seamlessly with brand agents, addressing a critical limitation in current AI capabilities.

## ASI:One: The Core of Coordination
At the heart of this launch is ASI:One, a personal AI orchestration platform that serves as an “intelligence layer.” Unlike traditional AI models that merely offer suggestions, ASI:One is built to coordinate multiple agents, facilitating complex tasks that require collaboration across different entities. For instance, when a user wants to plan a trip, ASI:One retrieves stored preferences—such as budget and dietary restrictions—and delegates tasks to verified agents, generating actionable outputs rather than generic recommendations.

This innovative approach stands in stark contrast to conventional large language models (LLMs), which often rely on APIs to surface information. ASI:One is designed for orchestration, ensuring that agents can execute transactions and complete workflows effectively. Sheikh emphasizes that this system is not about searching for options but about orchestrating a cohesive execution of tasks.

## Fetch Business: Ensuring Trust and Verification
To enable reliable interactions between consumers and brands, Fetch has introduced Fetch Business, a verification and discovery portal. This platform allows organizations to verify their identities and claim official Brand Agent handles, akin to domain registration systems like ICANN. By providing verified identities, Fetch aims to protect consumers from counterfeit agents, a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of AI agents.

Fetch Business also includes low-code tools that enable small businesses to create agents quickly, ensuring that even those without extensive technical expertise can participate in this new ecosystem. The verification process is designed to be straightforward, allowing businesses to establish trust and credibility in their interactions with consumers.

## Agentverse: The Directory for AI Agents
Completing the trio of launches is Agentverse, an open directory that hosts over two million agents across various sectors, including travel, retail, and entertainment. This platform serves as a discovery layer, addressing a significant challenge faced by many AI agents: lack of visibility. Sheikh notes that without a universal way to discover agents, most remain underutilized. 

Agentverse is designed to be platform-agnostic, allowing agents built with any framework to join and interoperate. This open architecture is crucial for the future of AI agents, as it enables seamless communication and data exchange between diverse agents. The integration of payment pathways further enhances the functionality of Agentverse, allowing agents to execute transactions securely.

## Implications for the Future of AI
Fetch's launch comes at a critical juncture in the AI landscape, where the shift from static chat interfaces to autonomous agents is gaining momentum. The interconnected nature of ASI:One, Fetch Business, and Agentverse addresses many limitations currently faced by AI systems, such as siloed architectures and weak verification standards. By providing a robust infrastructure for agentic systems, Fetch is positioning itself as a foundational player in the emerging agent economy.

Moreover, the emphasis on secure data exchange, verified identities, and cross-platform coordination reflects a growing recognition of the need for trust in digital interactions. As consumers increasingly rely on AI to assist with complex tasks, the importance of establishing a reliable framework cannot be overstated.

## Conclusion: A New Foundation for AI Agents
Fetch AI's launch of ASI:One, Fetch Business, and Agentverse signifies a transformative step in the evolution of AI agents. By creating an ecosystem that prioritizes trust, coordination, and interoperability, Fetch is laying the groundwork for a future where personal AIs can effectively collaborate with verified brand agents. This interconnected stack not only enhances user experience but also sets the stage for a more integrated and functional digital landscape, where AI can truly act on behalf of users, making technology more responsive and effective in meeting their needs.
