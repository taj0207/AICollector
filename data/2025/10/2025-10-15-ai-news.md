- [Dfinity launches Caffeine, an AI platform that builds production apps from natural language prompts](https://venturebeat.com/ai/dfinity-launches-caffeine-an-ai-platform-that-builds-production-apps-from) — 17:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > <p>The <a href="https://dfinity.org/"><u>Dfinity Foundation</u></a> on Wednesday released <a href="https://caffeine.ai/"><u>Caffeine</u></a>, an artificial intelligence platform that allows users to build and deploy web applications through natural language conversation alone, bypassing traditional coding entirely. The system, which became publicly available today, represents a fundamental departure from existing AI coding assistants by building applications on a specialized decentralized infrastructure designed specifically for autonomous AI development.</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a>, <a href="https://cursor.com/"><u>Cursor</u></a>, or other &quot;vibe coding&quot; tools that help human developers write code faster, Caffeine positions itself as a complete replacement for technical teams. Users describe what they want in plain language, and an ensemble of AI models writes, deploys, and continually updates production-grade applications — with no human intervention in the codebase itself.</p><p>&quot;In the future, you as a prospective app owner or service owner… will talk to AI. AI will give you what you want on a URL,&quot; said Dominic Williams, founder and chief scientist at the Dfinity Foundation, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;You will use that, completely interact productively, and you&#x27;ll just keep talking to AI to evolve what that does. The AI, or an ensemble of AIs, will be your tech team.&quot;</p><p>The platform has attracted significant early interest: more than 15,000 alpha users tested Caffeine before its public release, with daily active users representing 26% of those who received access codes — &quot;early Facebook kind of levels,&quot; according to Williams. The foundation reports some users spending entire days building applications on the platform, forcing Dfinity to consider usage limits due to underlying AI infrastructure costs.</p><h2><b>Why Caffeine&#x27;s custom programming language guarantees your data won&#x27;t disappear</b></h2><p>Caffeine&#x27;s most significant technical claim addresses a problem that has plagued AI-generated code: data loss during application updates. The platform builds applications using <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/home"><u>Motoko</u></a>, a programming language developed by Dfinity specifically for AI use, which provides mathematical guarantees that upgrades cannot accidentally delete user data.</p><p>&quot;When AI is updating apps and services in production, a mistake cannot lose data. That&#x27;s a guarantee,&quot; Williams said. &quot;It&#x27;s not like there are some safeguards to try and stop it losing data. This language framework gives it rails that guarantee if an upgrade, an update to its app&#x27;s underlying logic, would cause data loss, the upgrade fails and the AI just tries again.&quot;</p><p>This addresses what Williams characterizes as critical failures in competing platforms. User forums for tools like <a href="https://lovable.dev/"><u>Lovable</u></a> and <a href="https://replit.com/"><u>Replit</u></a>, he notes, frequently report three major problems: applications that become irreparably broken as complexity increases, security vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access, and mysterious data loss during updates.</p><p>Traditional tech stacks evolved to meet human developer needs — familiarity with SQL databases, preference for known programming languages, existing skill investments. &quot;That&#x27;s how the traditional tech stacks evolved. It&#x27;s really evolved to meet human needs,&quot; Williams explained. &quot;But in the future, it&#x27;s going to be different. You&#x27;re not going to care how the AI did it. Instead, for you, AI is the tech stack.&quot;</p><p>Caffeine&#x27;s architecture reflects this philosophy. Applications run entirely on the <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"><u>Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)</u></a>, a blockchain-based network that Dfinity launched in May 2021 after raising over $100 million from investors including <a href="https://a16z.com/dfinity/"><u>Andreessen Horowitz</u></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/dfinity/"><u>Polychain Capital</u></a>. The ICP uses what Dfinity calls &quot;chain-key cryptography&quot; to create what Williams describes as &quot;tamper-proof&quot; code — applications that are mathematically guaranteed to execute their written logic without interference from traditional cyberattacks.</p><p>&quot;The code can&#x27;t be affected by ransomware, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about malware in the same way you do,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Configuration errors don&#x27;t result in traditional cyber attacks. That passive traditional cyber attacks isn&#x27;t something you need to worry about.&quot;</p><h2><b>How &#x27;orthogonal persistence&#x27; lets AI build apps without managing databases</b></h2><p>At the heart of Caffeine&#x27;s technical approach is a concept called &quot;<a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/orthogonal-persistence/"><u>orthogonal persistence</u></a>,&quot; which fundamentally reimagines how applications store and manage data. In traditional development, programmers must write extensive code to move data between application logic and separate database systems — marshaling data in and out of SQL servers, managing connections, handling synchronization.</p><p><a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/home"><u>Motoko</u></a> eliminates this entirely. Williams demonstrated with a simple example: defining a blog post data type and declaring a variable to store an array of posts requires just two lines of code. &quot;This declaration is all that&#x27;s necessary to have the blog maintain its list of posts,&quot; he explained during a presentation on the technology. &quot;Compare that to traditional IT where in order to persist the blog posts, you&#x27;d have to marshal them in and out of a database server. This is quite literally orders of magnitude more simple.&quot;</p><p>This abstraction allows AI to work at a higher conceptual level, focusing on application logic rather than infrastructure plumbing. &quot;Logic and data are kind of the same,&quot; Williams said. &quot;This is one of the things that enables AI to build far more complicated functionality than it could otherwise do.&quot;</p><p>The system also employs what Dfinity calls &quot;loss-safe data migration.&quot; When AI needs to modify an application&#x27;s data structure — adding a &quot;likes&quot; field to blog posts, for example — it must write migration logic in two passes. The framework automatically verifies that the transformation won&#x27;t result in data loss, refusing to compile or deploy code that could delete information unless explicitly instructed.</p><h2><b>From million-dollar SaaS contracts to conversational app building in minutes</b></h2><p>Williams positions <a href="https://caffeine.ai/"><u>Caffeine</u></a> as particularly transformative for enterprise IT, where he claims costs could fall to &quot;1% of what they were before&quot; while time-to-market shrinks to similar fractions. The platform targets a spectrum from individual creators to large corporations, all of whom currently face either expensive development teams or constraining low-code templates.</p><p>&quot;A corporation or government department might want to create a corporate portal or CRM, ERP functionality,&quot; Williams said, referring to customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems. &quot;They will otherwise have to obtain this by signing up for some incredibly expensive SaaS service where they become locked in, their data gets stuck, and they still have to spend a lot of money on consultants customizing the functionality.&quot;</p><p>Applications built through <a href="https://caffeine.ai/"><u>Caffeine</u></a> are owned entirely by their creators and cannot be shut down by centralized parties — a consequence of running on the decentralized <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"><u>Internet Computer</u></a> network rather than traditional cloud providers like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=48ebaf74-0ade-44c7-b8c2-12a0e7718d21&amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5jTV7r4lhg4v2_akcje7Hv2RgfrbNK3YJRonxmzg3lQnhP5Dtop_waAscnEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651751059777!e!!g!!amazon%20web%20services!19852662197!145019195737&amp;gad_campaignid=19852662197&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADjHtp-sA3cSfcBU924i9KU_I-qMh&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5jTV7r4lhg4v2_akcje7Hv2RgfrbNK3YJRonxmzg3lQnhP5Dtop_waAscnEALw_wcB"><u>Amazon Web Services</u></a>. &quot;When someone says built on the internet computer, it actually means built on the internet computer,&quot; Williams emphasized, contrasting this with blockchain projects that merely host tokens while running actual applications on centralized infrastructure.</p><p>The platform demonstrated this versatility during a July 2025 hackathon in San Francisco, where participants created applications ranging from a &quot;Will Maker&quot; tool for generating legal documents, to &quot;Blue Lens,&quot; a voice-AI water quality monitoring system, to &quot;Road Patrol,&quot; a gamified community reporting app for infrastructure problems. Critically, many of these came from non-technical participants with no coding background.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m from a non-technical background, I&#x27;m actually a quality assurance professional,&quot; said the creator of Blue Lens in a video testimonial. &quot;Through Caffeine I can build something really intuitive and next-gen to the public.&quot; The application integrated multiple external services — Eleven Labs for voice AI, real-time government water data through retrieval-augmented generation, and Midjourney-generated visual assets — all coordinated through conversational prompts.</p><h2><b>What separates Caffeine from GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and the &#x27;vibe coding&#x27; wave</b></h2><p><a href="http://caffeine.ai"><u>Caffeine</u></a> enters a crowded market of AI-assisted development tools, but Williams argues the competition isn&#x27;t truly comparable. <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a>, <a href="https://cursor.com/"><u>Cursor</u></a>, and similar tools serve human developers working with traditional technology stacks. Platforms like <a href="https://replit.com/"><u>Replit</u></a> and <a href="https://lovable.dev/"><u>Lovable</u></a> occupy a middle ground, offering &quot;vibe coding&quot; that mixes AI generation with human editing.</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re a Node.js developer, you know you&#x27;re working with the traditional stack, and you might want to do your coding with Copilot or using Claude or using Cursor,&quot; Williams said. &quot;That&#x27;s a very different thing to what Caffeine is offering. There&#x27;ll always be cases where you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to hand over the logic of the control system for a new nuclear missile silo to AI. But there&#x27;s going to be these holdout areas, right? And there&#x27;s all the legacy stuff that has to be maintained.&quot;</p><p>The key distinction, according to Williams, lies in production readiness. Existing AI coding tools excel at rapid prototyping but stumble when applications grow complex or require guaranteed reliability. Reddit forums for these platforms document users hitting insurmountable walls where applications break irreparably, or where AI-generated code introduces security vulnerabilities.</p><p>&quot;As the demands and the requirements become more complicated, eventually you can hit a limit, and when you hit that limit, not only can you not go any further, but sometimes your app will get broken and there&#x27;s no way of going back to where you were before,&quot; Williams said. &quot;That can&#x27;t happen with productive apps, and it also can&#x27;t be the case that you&#x27;re getting hacked and losing data, because once you go hands-free, if you like, and there&#x27;s no tech team, there&#x27;s no technical people involved, who&#x27;s going to run the backups and restore your app?&quot;</p><p>The Internet Computer&#x27;s architecture addresses this through Byzantine fault tolerance — even if attackers gain physical control over some network hardware, they cannot corrupt applications or their data. &quot;This is the beginning of a compute revolution and it&#x27;s also the perfect platform for AI to build on,&quot; Williams said.</p><h2><b>Inside the vision: A web that programs itself through natural language</b></h2><p>Dfinity frames <a href="https://caffeine.ai/"><u>Caffeine</u></a> within a broader vision it calls the &quot;<a href="https://caffeine.ai/"><u>self-writing internet</u></a>,&quot; where the web literally programs itself through natural language interaction. This represents what Williams describes as a &quot;seismic shift coming to tech&quot; — from human developers selecting technology stacks based on their existing skills, to AI selecting optimal implementations invisible to users.</p><p>&quot;You don&#x27;t care about whether some human being has learned all of the different platforms and Amazon Web Services or something like that. You don&#x27;t care about that. You just care: Is it secure? Do you get security guarantees? Is it resilient? What&#x27;s the level of resilience?&quot; Williams said. &quot;Those are the new parameters.&quot;</p><p>The platform demonstrated this during live demonstrations, including at the <a href="https://worldcomputer.com/"><u>World Computer Summit 2025</u></a> in Zurich. Williams created a talent recruitment application from scratch in under two minutes, then modified it in real-time while the application ran with users already interacting with it. &quot;You will continue talking to the AI and just keep on refreshing the URL to see the changes,&quot; he explained.</p><p>This capability extends to complex scenarios. During demonstrations, Williams showed building a tennis lesson booking system, an e-commerce platform, and an event registration system — all simultaneously, working on multiple applications in parallel. &quot;We predict that as people get very proficient with <a href="https://caffeine.ai/"><u>Caffeine</u></a>, they could be working on even 10 apps in parallel,&quot; he said.</p><p>The system writes substantial code: a simple personal blog generated 700 lines of code in a couple of minutes. More complex applications can involve thousands of lines across frontend and backend components, all abstracted away from the user who only describes desired functionality.</p><h2><b>The economics of cloning: How Caffeine&#x27;s app market challenges traditional stores</b></h2><p>Caffeine&#x27;s economic model differs fundamentally from traditional software-as-a-service platforms. Applications run on the <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"><u>Internet Computer Protocol</u></a>, which uses a &quot;reverse gas model&quot; where developers pay for computation rather than users paying transaction fees. The platform includes an integrated App Market where creators can publish applications for others to clone and adapt — creating what Dfinity envisions as a new economic ecosystem.</p><p>&quot;App stores today obviously operate on gatekeeping,&quot; said Pierre Samaties, chief business officer at Dfinity, during the World Computer Summit. &quot;That&#x27;s going to erode.&quot; Rather than purchasing applications, users can clone them and modify them for their own purposes — fundamentally different from Apple&#x27;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/"><u>App Store</u></a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en_US"><u>Google Play</u></a> models.</p><p>Williams acknowledges that <a href="https://caffeine.ai/"><u>Caffeine</u></a> itself currently runs on centralized infrastructure, despite building applications on the decentralized Internet Computer. &quot;Caffeine itself actually is centralized. It uses aspects of the Internet Computer. We want Caffeine itself to run on the Internet Computer in the future, but it&#x27;s not there now,&quot; he said. The platform leverages commercially available foundation models from companies like Anthropic, whose <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet"><u>Claude Sonnet</u></a> model powers much of Caffeine&#x27;s backend logic.</p><p>This pragmatic approach reflects Dfinity&#x27;s strategy of using best-in-class AI models while focusing its own development on the specialized infrastructure and programming language designed for AI use. &quot;These content models have been developed by companies with enormous budgets, absolutely enormous budgets,&quot; Williams said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think in the near future we&#x27;ll run AI on the Internet Computer for that reason, unless there&#x27;s a special case.&quot;</p><h2><b>A decade in the making: From Ethereum roots to the self-writing internet</b></h2><p>The <a href="https://dfinity.org/"><u>Dfinity Foundation</u></a> has pursued this vision since Williams began researching decentralized networks in late 2013. After involvement with Ethereum before its 2015 launch, Williams became fascinated with the concept of a &quot;world computer&quot;—a public blockchain network that could host not just tokens but entire applications and services.</p><p>&quot;By 2015 I was talking about network-focused drivers, Dfinity back then, and that could really operate as an alternative tech stack, and eventually host even things like social networks and massive enterprise systems,&quot; Williams said. The foundation launched the Internet Computer Protocol in May 2021, initially focusing on Web3 developers. Despite not being among the highest-valued blockchain projects, ICP consistently ranks in the top 10 for developer numbers.</p><p>The pivot to AI-driven development came from recognizing that &quot;in the future, the tech stack will be AI,&quot; according to Williams. This realization led to Caffeine&#x27;s development, announced on Dfinity&#x27;s public roadmap in March 2025 and demonstrated at the <a href="https://worldcomputer.com/"><u>World Computer Summit</u></a> in June 2025.</p><p>One successful example of the Dfinity vision running in production is <a href="https://oc.app/"><u>OpenChat</u></a>, a messaging application that runs entirely on the Internet Computer and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with tens of thousands of participants voting on source code updates through algorithmic governance. &quot;The community is actually controlling the source code updates,&quot; Williams explained. &quot;Developers propose updates, community reads the updates, and if the community is happy, OpenChat updates itself.&quot;</p><h2><b>The skeptics weigh in: Crypto baggage and real-world testing ahead</b></h2><p>The platform faces several challenges. Dfinity&#x27;s crypto industry roots may create perception problems in enterprise markets, Williams acknowledges. &quot;The Web3 industry&#x27;s reputation is a bit tarnished and probably rightfully so,&quot; he said during the World Computer Summit. &quot;Now people can, for themselves, experience what a decentralized network is. We&#x27;re going to see self-writing take over the enterprise space because the speed and efficiency are just incredible.&quot;</p><p>The foundation&#x27;s history includes controversy: ICP&#x27;s token launched in 2021 at over $100 per token with an all-time high around $700, then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/dfinity-icp-ico.html"><u>crashed below $3 in 2023</u></a> before recovering. The project has faced legal challenges, including class action lawsuits <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/icp-cryptocurrency-crash.html"><u>alleging misleading investors</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/column-new-york-times-crypto-analyst-beat-dfinity-defamation-claims-2023-11-14/"><u>Dfinity filed defamation claims</u></a> against industry critics.</p><p>Technical limitations also remain. Caffeine cannot yet compile React front-ends on the Internet Computer itself, requiring some off-chain processing. Complex integrations with traditional systems — payment processing through Stripe, for example — still require centralized components. &quot;Your app is running end-to-end on the Internet Computer, then when it needs to actually accept payment, it&#x27;s going to hand over to your Stripe account,&quot; Williams explained.</p><p>The platform&#x27;s claims about data loss prevention and security guarantees, while technically grounded in the Motoko language design and Internet Computer architecture, remain to be tested at scale with diverse real-world applications. The 26% daily active user rate from alpha testing is impressive but comes from a self-selected group of early adopters.</p><h2><b>When five billion smartphone users become developers</b></h2><p>Williams rejects concerns that AI-driven development will eliminate software engineering jobs, arguing instead for market expansion. &quot;The self-writing internet empowers eight billion non-technical people,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of these people will enter roles in tech, becoming prompt engineers, tech entrepreneurs, or helping run online communities. Humanity will create millions of new custom apps and services, and a subset of those will require professional human assistance.&quot;</p><p>During his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN_JleruySc"><u>World Computer Summit demonstration</u></a>, Williams was explicit about the scale of transformation Dfinity envisions. &quot;Today there are about 35,000 Web3 engineers in the world. Worldwide there are about 15 million full-stack engineers,&quot; he said. &quot;But tomorrow with the self-writing internet, everyone will be a builder. Today there are already about five billion people with internet-connected smartphones and they&#x27;ll all be able to use Caffeine.&quot;</p><p>The hackathon results suggest this isn&#x27;t pure hyperbole.

And it has been, in many ways, with numerous leading AI model providers such as <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-unveils-chatgpt-agent-that-gives-chatgpt-its-own-computer-to-autonomously-use-your-email-and-web-apps-download-and-create-files-for-you">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-ai-can-now-surf-the-web-for-you-click-on-buttons-and-fill-out-forms">Google</a>, and even Chinese competitors like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-deepseek-moment-for-ai-agents-is-here-meet-alibabas-open-source-tongyi">Alibaba releasing</a> fine-tuned AI models or applications designed to focus on a narrow set of tasks, such as web search and report writing. </p><p>But one big hurdle to a future of highly performant, reliable, AI agents remains: getting them to stay on task when the task extends over a number of steps.<a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/"> Third-party benchmark tests </a>show even the most powerful AI models experience higher failure rates the more steps they take to complete a task, and the longer time they spend on it (exceeding hours). </p><p>A <a href="https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.05608">new academic framework called EAGLET</a> proposes a practical and efficient method to improve long-horizon task performance in LLM-based agents — without the need for manual data labeling or retraining. </p><p>Developed by researchers from Tsinghua University, Peking University, DeepLang AI, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,<b> EAGLET offers a &quot;global planner&quot; that can be integrated into existing agent workflows to reduce hallucinations and improve task efficiency.</b></p><p>EAGLET is a fine-tuned language model that interprets task instructions — typically provided as prompts by the user or the agent&#x27;s operating environment — and generates a high-level plan for the agent (powered by its own LLM). It does not intervene during execution, but its up-front guidance helps reduce planning errors and improve task completion rates.</p><h3><b>Addressing the Planning Problem in Long-Horizon Agents</b></h3><p>Many LLM-based agents struggle with long-horizon tasks because they rely on reactive, step-by-step reasoning. This approach often leads to trial-and-error behavior, planning hallucinations, and inefficient trajectories. </p><p>EAGLET tackles this limitation by introducing a <b>global planning module</b> that works alongside the executor agent. </p><p>Instead of blending planning and action generation in a single model, EAGLET separates them, enabling more coherent, task-level strategies.</p><h3><b>A Two-Stage Training Pipeline with No Human Annotations</b></h3><p>EAGLET’s planner is trained using a two-stage process that requires no human-written plans or annotations. </p><p>The first stage involves generating synthetic plans with high-capability LLMs, such as GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think. </p><p>These plans are then filtered using a novel strategy called homologous consensus filtering, which retains only those that improve task performance for both expert and novice executor agents. </p><p>In the second stage, a rule-based reinforcement learning process further refines the planner, using a custom-designed reward function to assess how much each plan helps multiple agents succeed.</p><h3><b>Introducing the Executor Capability Gain Reward (ECGR)</b></h3><p>One of EAGLET’s key innovations is the Executor Capability Gain Reward (ECGR). </p><p>This reward measures the value of a generated plan by checking whether it helps both high- and low-capability agents complete tasks more successfully and with fewer steps. </p><p>It also includes a decay factor to favor shorter, more efficient task trajectories. This approach avoids over-rewarding plans that are only useful to already-competent agents and promotes more generalizable planning guidance.</p><h3><b>Compatible with Existing Agents and Models</b></h3><p>The EAGLET planner is designed to be modular and &quot;plug-and-play,&quot; meaning it can be inserted into existing agent pipelines without requiring executor retraining. </p><p>In evaluations, the planner boosted performance across a variety of foundational models, including GPT-4.1, GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and Qwen2.5. </p><p>It also proved effective regardless of prompting strategy, working well with standard ReAct-style prompts as well as approaches like Reflexion.</p><h3><b>State-of-the-Art Performance Across Benchmarks</b></h3><p>EAGLET was tested on three widely used benchmarks for long-horizon agent tasks: ScienceWorld, which simulates scientific experiments in a text-based lab environment; ALFWorld, which tasks agents with completing household activities through natural language in a simulated home setting; and WebShop, which evaluates goal-driven behavior in a realistic online shopping interface.</p><p>Across all three, executor agents equipped with EAGLET outperformed their non-planning counterparts and other planning baselines, including MPO and KnowAgent. </p><p>In experiments with the open source Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, EAGLET boosted average performance from 39.5 to 59.4, a +19.9 point gain across tasks. </p><p>On ScienceWorld unseen scenarios, it raised performance from 42.2 to 61.6. </p><p>In ALFWorld seen scenarios, EAGLET improved outcomes from 22.9 to 54.3, a more than 2.3× increase in performance.</p><p>Even stronger gains were seen with more capable models. </p><p>For instance, GPT-4.1 improved from 75.5 to 82.2 average score with EAGLET, and GPT-5 rose from 84.5 to 88.1, despite already being strong performers. </p><p>In some benchmarks, performance gains were as high as +11.8 points, such as when combining EAGLET with the ETO executor method on ALFWorld unseen tasks.</p><p>Compared to other planning baselines like MPO, EAGLET consistently delivered higher task completion rates. For example, on ALFWorld unseen tasks with GPT-4.1, MPO achieved 79.1, while EAGLET scored 83.6—a +4.5 point advantage.</p><p>Additionally, the paper reports that agents using EAGLET complete tasks in fewer steps on average. With GPT-4.1 as executor, average step count dropped from 13.0 (no planner) to 11.1 (EAGLET). With GPT-5, it dropped from 11.4 to 9.4, supporting the claim of improved execution efficiency.</p><h3><b>Efficiency Gains in Training and Execution</b></h3><p>Compared to RL-based methods like GiGPO, which can require hundreds of training iterations, EAGLET achieved better or comparable results with roughly one-eighth the training effort. </p><p>This efficiency also carries over into execution: agents using EAGLET typically needed fewer steps to complete tasks. This translates into reduced inference time and compute cost in production scenarios.</p><h3><b>No Public Code—Yet</b></h3><p>As of the version submitted to arXiv, the authors have not released an open-source implementation of EAGLET. It is unclear if or when the code will be released, under what license, or how it will be maintained, which may limit the near-term utility of the framework for enterprise deployment. </p><p>VentureBeat has reached out to the authors to clarify these points and will update this piece when we hear back.</p><h3><b>Enterprise Deployment Questions Remain</b></h3><p>While the planner is described as plug-and-play, it remains unclear whether EAGLET can be easily integrated into popular enterprise agent frameworks such as LangChain or AutoGen, or if it requires a custom stack to support plan-execute separation. </p><p>Similarly, the training setup leverages multiple executor agents, which may be difficult to replicate in enterprise environments with limited model access. VentureBeat has asked the researchers whether the homologous consensus filtering method can be adapted for teams that only have access to one executor model or limited compute resources.</p><p>EAGLET’s authors report success across model types and sizes, but it is not yet known what the minimal viable model scale is for practical deployment. For example, can enterprise teams use the planner effectively with sub-10B parameter open models in latency-sensitive environments? Additionally, the framework may offer industry-specific value in domains like customer support or IT automation, but it remains to be seen how easily the planner can be fine-tuned or customized for such verticals.</p><h3><b>Real-Time vs. Pre-Generated Planning</b></h3><p>Another open question is how EAGLET is best deployed in practice. Should the planner operate in real-time alongside executors within a loop, or is it better used offline to pre-generate global plans for known task types? Each approach has implications for latency, cost, and operational complexity. VentureBeat has posed this question to the authors and will report any insights that emerge.</p><h3><b>Strategic Tradeoffs for Enterprise Teams</b></h3><p>For technical leaders at medium-to-large enterprises, EAGLET represents a compelling proof of concept for improving the reliability and efficiency of LLM agents. But without public tooling or implementation guidelines, the framework still presents a build-versus-wait decision. Enterprises must weigh the potential gains in task performance and efficiency against the costs of reproducing or approximating the training process in-house.</p><h3><b>Potential Use Cases in Enterprise Settings</b></h3><p>For enterprises developing agentic AI systems—especially in environments requiring stepwise planning, such as IT automation, customer support, or online interactions—EAGLET offers a template for how to incorporate planning without retraining. Its ability to guide both open- and closed-source models, along with its efficient training method, may make it an appealing starting point for teams seeking to improve agent performance with minimal overhead.</p>
