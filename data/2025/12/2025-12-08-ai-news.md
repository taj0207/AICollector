- [Tracking every decision, dollar and delay: The new process intelligence engine driving public-sector progress](https://venturebeat.com/ai/tracking-every-decision-dollar-and-delay-the-new-process-intelligence-engine) — 21:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > Presented by CelonisThe State of Oklahoma discovered its blind spots the hard way. In April 2023, a legislative report revealed its agencies had spent $3 billion without proper oversight. Janet Morrow, Director of Oklahoma's Risk, Assessment and Compliance Division, set out to track thousands of monthly transactions across dozens of disconnected systems.The Sooner State became the first U.S. state to apply process intelligence (PI) technology for procurement oversight. The transformation, Morrow says, was immediate. Real-time monitoring replaced multi-year audit cycles. The platform from market-leader Celonis quickly identified more than $10 million of inappropriate spending. And the oversight team was able to redeploy staff from 13 to 5 members while dramatically increasing effectiveness.“Process for Progress”: A global movementOklahoma's pioneering success using powerful new process technology spotlights an emerging global trend. Morrow was among more than 3,000 leaders gathered at Celosphere, Celonis’s recent annual conference, to explore how AI, powered with business context by PI, can deliver commercial returns as well as environmental and financial benefits worldwide. The vision: process intelligence as a foundation for public and social progress. The movement sees the combination of AI and PI like Oklahoma’s as a powerful way to help governments and other organizations deliver vital services more cost effectively, with improved decisions and better-informed policies. From procurement to juvenile justice to healthcare and environment, scores of organizations are now getting a first look at the famously byzantine, opaque way things get done.For veteran financial leader Aubrey Vaughan — now Vice President of Strategy for Public Sector at Celonis and formerly a top executive at a major financial software firm — the move toward real process improvement has been a long time coming. He recalls testifying proudly before Congress a few years ago about uncovering $10 billion in improper government payments at his previous company. Afterward, a senior government official pulled him aside and suggested he downplay the achievement.The reason, he was told: "The next question they're going to ask you is, ‘Why is that happening?’” says Vaughn. “Today we can answer not only why, but how we fix it." Across the U.S. and the globe, public agencies are tightening budgets. Desire to deploy AI to close the gap is colliding with a hard reality: you can't automate what you don't understand. Here are three real-world examples of organizations using PI and AI for better outcomes. Oklahoma: Real-time AI spending analysis boosts accountability Within just 60 days of implementation, Celonis reviewed $29.4 billion worth of purchase order lines, identifying $8.48 billion in statutory exempt purchases and flagging problematic transactions. The system now provides real-time feedback to buyers within 15 minutes of purchases, allowing immediate course correction.The system revealed agencies were purchasing from a vendor at prices 45% lower than the statewide contract, forcing renegotiation. "Real-time AI analysis has increased accountability by providing key insights into spending patterns and streamlining contract utilization," Morrow explains. Last year, Oklahoma adopted Celonis's Copilot feature, which uses conversational AI to let executives ask questions in plain language. Now, when the Governor or a cabinet member wonders about a contract, they get answers in seconds, not weeks, Morrow says. Her group is expanding the technology to other agencies. It’s also exploring how emerging AI agent capabilities can further automate compliance and spending analysis.In Texas, uncovering a startling hidden pattern in young offenders At Evident Change, a social research non-profit, Erin Espinosa's work is about good stewardship — not of taxpayer money, but of young lives. Analyzing 400,000 data points from juvenile justice and public health systems in Texas, the former probation officer-turned Ph.D. made a startling discovery: the mental health treatment that young offenders received (or didn’t) was a stronger predictor of incarceration than the seriousness of the offense that brought them into the system. Espinosa told courts, legislatures, Congress. Nobody believed it.Frustrated, she partnered with Monica Chiarini Tremblay, a professor at William & Mary College. While traditional analysis showed correlation, Celonis process intelligence helped the pair show a clear, quantitative causation: A fragmented mental health system was actively pushing kids toward worse outcomes. Further machine learning analysis also demonstrated that doubling down on the same interventions increased likelihood of undesirable out-of-home placement for juvenile offenders.Recently accepted for academic publication, the real-world findings represent both indictment and opportunity. Espinosa and Tremblay are planning a larger 2026 pilot implementation of PI-based analysis, bringing together social services, juvenile justice, mental health providers, and education officials. "This is a perfect intersection of business, social work, adolescent development, and community financial implications," Espinosa says. They’re now exploring how AI agent technologies could flag at-risk youth and trigger coordinated responses before patterns become entrenched.A $1-trillion defense budget — that has never passed a clean audit The U.S. Department of Defense faces financial challenges on an exponentially larger scale. As Acting Secretary of the Army, Robert M. Speer hired a big-three accounting firm to map the service’s financial processes. Three years later, the analysis was obsolete — processes had changed dramatically. So, when Speer first saw process intelligence, he was truly excited about what it revealed. "I can see not only the data,” he explained, “but where it's coming from, the business process delivering it."Tom Steffens, former Deputy Chief Financial Officer of Defense, agrees: "There's clearly a missing piece to the puzzle." Both recently joined Celonis's Public Sector Advisory Board. They see potential for AI agents to automate compliance monitoring across DoD's complex ecosystem.The stakes are unimaginably huge. The Department of Defense will receive more than a trillion dollars in funding in FY 2026. It’s also the only federal cabinet agency that's never passed a clean audit. Beyond accounting, fast-changing geopolitics and modern warfare demands systems as dynamic as current battle environments. "We're talking about the ability to shift in real time," says Speer. "We know that’s what happens on the battlefield, but we need something on the back end of those enabling processes and systems to ensure that happens correctly." The pair is working with defense leaders to show how process intelligence can create the foundation for transformation — enabling modeling and scenario planning that can support battlefield decisions with data-driven confidence rather than delayed, obsolete information.Efforts to modernize and optimize complex government systems and processes got a big boost recently. Working with partner Knox Systems, Celonis received FedRAMP authorization earlier this year, the security credential required for federal cloud services. "Knox powers the most secure and longest-running managed federal cloud," notes CEO Irina Denisenko, supporting 15+ federal agencies. The authorization positions the technology "as the backbone of compliance for the next generation of government SaaS."Where process meets purposeEarly public sector adopters are proving what's possible with process intelligence — from identifying billions in potential savings to revealing why children enter the prison pipeline. The potential extends wherever public funds shape public good: climate response, education, infrastructure, emergency services.Advocates often speak of “process for progress” or "process for empathy" — using transparency to change minds and hearts, not just policies. Says Chiarini Tremblay, who worked on the Texas juvenile offenders’ system: "We have to understand complex systems and make data-driven decisions, but the goal is always improving outcomes for people."It’s not just a U.S. movement. In the UK, for example, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust have deployed PI with dramatic effect. Director Andy Hardy used Celonis to analyze 244,000 outpatient cases, revealing massive variation in care delivery.By optimizing appointment reminders from four to 14 days before visits, the trust enabled earlier cancellations and saw an additional 1,800 patients weekly. The waiting list was reduced by 5,300 patients in eight weeks. Concludes Hardy: "Data understandable to clinicians is as important as scalpels." Technology continues to race ahead. At Celosphere 2025, Celonis unveiled a host of new offerings and platform updates for public and private sector organizations including the Orchestration Engine, which coordinates actions across workflows involving AI agents, human tasks, and legacy systems.All are built on the Celonis Process Intelligence Graph, which creates a "living digital twin" of a business or public agency’s processes. It’s system-agnostic, working across disconnected systems typical to government operations — integrating decades-old mainframes and cutting-edge cloud applications simultaneously.Agency heads and others note, however, that success demands more than software. For example, when Oklahoma reduced its oversight team from 13 to 5, resistance emerged. Morrow's team invested heavily in training and change management. Process intelligence reveals improvement opportunities, but people implement solutions’ she explains. Ongoing, long-term education and cultural change are needed. “Continuous operational improvement is a lifestyle,” says Celonis’s Vaughn. “You need to have a culture that wants to build better processes, better systems, more efficient systems.”The tools are ready. The business case is proven. What remains is the will to change — and the courage to look clearly at the systems meant to serve the public good.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

- [Z.ai debuts open source GLM-4.6V, a native tool-calling vision model for multimodal reasoning](https://venturebeat.com/ai/z-ai-debuts-open-source-glm-4-6v-a-native-tool-calling-vision-model-for) — 17:03 · VentureBeat AI
  > Chinese AI startup Zhipu AI aka Z.ai has released its GLM-4.6V series, a new generation of open-source vision-language models (VLMs) optimized for multimodal reasoning, frontend automation, and high-efficiency deployment. The release includes two models in "large" and "small" sizes: GLM-4.6V (106B), a larger 106-billion parameter model aimed at cloud-scale inferenceGLM-4.6V-Flash (9B), a smaller model of only 9 billion parameters designed for low-latency, local applicationsRecall that generally speaking, models with more parameters — or internal settings governing their behavior, i.e. weights and biases — are more powerful, performant, and capable of performing at a higher general level across more varied tasks.However, smaller models can offer better efficiency for edge or real-time applications where latency and resource constraints are critical.The defining innovation in this series is the introduction of native function calling in a vision-language model—enabling direct use of tools such as search, cropping, or chart recognition with visual inputs. With a 128,000 token context length (equivalent to a 300-page novel's worth of text exchanged in a single input/output interaction with the user) and state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across more than 20 benchmarks, the GLM-4.6V series positions itself as a highly competitive alternative to both closed and open-source VLMs. It's available in the following formats:API access via OpenAI-compatible interfaceTry the demo on Zhipu’s web interfaceDownload weights from Hugging FaceDesktop assistant app available on Hugging Face SpacesLicensing and Enterprise UseGLM‑4.6V and GLM‑4.6V‑Flash are distributed under the MIT license, a permissive open-source license that allows free commercial and non-commercial use, modification, redistribution, and local deployment without obligation to open-source derivative works. This licensing model makes the series suitable for enterprise adoption, including scenarios that require full control over infrastructure, compliance with internal governance, or air-gapped environments.Model weights and documentation are publicly hosted on Hugging Face, with supporting code and tooling available on GitHub. The MIT license ensures maximum flexibility for integration into proprietary systems, including internal tools, production pipelines, and edge deployments.Architecture and Technical CapabilitiesThe GLM-4.6V models follow a conventional encoder-decoder architecture with significant adaptations for multimodal input. Both models incorporate a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder—based on AIMv2-Huge—and an MLP projector to align visual features with a large language model (LLM) decoder. Video inputs benefit from 3D convolutions and temporal compression, while spatial encoding is handled using 2D-RoPE and bicubic interpolation of absolute positional embeddings.A key technical feature is the system’s support for arbitrary image resolutions and aspect ratios, including wide panoramic inputs up to 200:1. In addition to static image and document parsing, GLM-4.6V can ingest temporal sequences of video frames with explicit timestamp tokens, enabling robust temporal reasoning.On the decoding side, the model supports token generation aligned with function-calling protocols, allowing for structured reasoning across text, image, and tool outputs. This is supported by extended tokenizer vocabulary and output formatting templates to ensure consistent API or agent compatibility.Native Multimodal Tool UseGLM-4.6V introduces native multimodal function calling, allowing visual assets—such as screenshots, images, and documents—to be passed directly as parameters to tools. This eliminates the need for intermediate text-only conversions, which have historically introduced information loss and complexity.The tool invocation mechanism works bi-directionally:Input tools can be passed images or videos directly (e.g., document pages to crop or analyze).Output tools such as chart renderers or web snapshot utilities return visual data, which GLM-4.6V integrates directly into the reasoning chain.In practice, this means GLM-4.6V can complete tasks such as:Generating structured reports from mixed-format documentsPerforming visual audit of candidate imagesAutomatically cropping figures from papers during generationConducting visual web search and answering multimodal queriesHigh Performance Benchmarks Compared to Other Similar-Sized ModelsGLM-4.6V was evaluated across more than 20 public benchmarks covering general VQA, chart understanding, OCR, STEM reasoning, frontend replication, and multimodal agents. According to the benchmark chart released by Zhipu AI:GLM-4.6V (106B) achieves SoTA or near-SoTA scores among open-source models of comparable size (106B) on MMBench, MathVista, MMLongBench, ChartQAPro, RefCOCO, TreeBench, and more.GLM-4.6V-Flash (9B) outperforms other lightweight models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B, GLM-4.1V-9B) across almost all categories tested.The 106B model’s 128K-token window allows it to outperform larger models like Step-3 (321B) and Qwen3-VL-235B on long-context document tasks, video summarization, and structured multimodal reasoning.Example scores from the leaderboard include:MathVista: 88.2 (GLM-4.6V) vs. 84.6 (GLM-4.5V) vs. 81.4 (Qwen3-VL-8B)WebVoyager: 81.0 vs. 68.4 (Qwen3-VL-8B)Ref-L4-test: 88.9 vs. 89.5 (GLM-4.5V), but with better grounding fidelity at 87.7 (Flash) vs. 86.8Both models were evaluated using the vLLM inference backend and support SGLang for video-based tasks.Frontend Automation and Long-Context WorkflowsZhipu AI emphasized GLM-4.6V’s ability to support frontend development workflows. The model can:Replicate pixel-accurate HTML/CSS/JS from UI screenshotsAccept natural language editing commands to modify layoutsIdentify and manipulate specific UI components visuallyThis capability is integrated into an end-to-end visual programming interface, where the model iterates on layout, design intent, and output code using its native understanding of screen captures.In long-document scenarios, GLM-4.6V can process up to 128,000 tokens—enabling a single inference pass across:150 pages of text (input)200 slide decks1-hour videosZhipu AI reported successful use of the model in financial analysis across multi-document corpora and in summarizing full-length sports broadcasts with timestamped event detection.Training and Reinforcement LearningThe model was trained using multi-stage pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Key innovations include:Curriculum Sampling (RLCS): Dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training samples based on model progressMulti-domain reward systems: Task-specific verifiers for STEM, chart reasoning, GUI agents, video QA, and spatial groundingFunction-aware training: Uses structured tags (e.g., , , ) to align reasoning and answer formattingThe reinforcement learning pipeline emphasizes verifiable rewards (RLVR) over human feedback (RLHF) for scalability, and avoids KL/entropy losses to stabilize training across multimodal domainsPricing (API)Zhipu AI offers competitive pricing for the GLM-4.6V series, with both the flagship model and its lightweight variant positioned for high accessibility.GLM-4.6V: $0.30 (input) / $0.90 (output) per 1M tokensGLM-4.6V-Flash: FreeCompared to major vision-capable and text-first LLMs, GLM-4.6V is among the most cost-efficient for multimodal reasoning at scale.

The flagship GLM‑4.5 and its smaller sibling GLM‑4.5‑Air both support reasoning, tool use, coding, and agentic behaviors, while offering strong performance across standard benchmarks. The models introduced dual reasoning modes (“thinking” and “non-thinking”) and could automatically generate complete PowerPoint presentations from a single prompt — a feature positioned for use in enterprise reporting, education, and internal comms workflows. Z.ai also extended the GLM‑4.5 series with additional variants such as GLM‑4.5‑X, AirX, and Flash, targeting ultra-fast inference and low-cost scenarios.Together, these features position the GLM‑4.5 series as a cost-effective, open, and production-ready alternative for enterprises needing autonomy over model deployment, lifecycle management, and integration pipelEcosystem ImplicationsThe GLM-4.6V release represents a notable advance in open-source multimodal AI. While large vision-language models have proliferated over the past year, few offer:Integrated visual tool usageStructured multimodal generationAgent-oriented memory and decision logicZhipu AI’s emphasis on “closing the loop” from perception to action via native function calling marks a step toward agentic multimodal systems. The model’s architecture and training pipeline show a continued evolution of the GLM family, positioning it competitively alongside offerings like OpenAI’s GPT-4V and Google DeepMind’s Gemini-VL.Takeaway for Enterprise LeadersWith GLM-4.6V, Zhipu AI introduces an open-source VLM capable of native visual tool use, long-context reasoning, and frontend automation. It sets new performance marks among models of similar size and provides a scalable platform for building agentic, multimodal AI systems.

- [Anthropic's Claude Code can now read your Slack messages and write code for you](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropics-claude-code-can-now-read-your-slack-messages-and-write-code-for) — 11:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > Anthropic on Monday launched a beta integration that connects its fast-growing Claude Code programming agent directly to Slack, allowing software engineers to delegate coding tasks without leaving the workplace messaging platform where much of their daily communication already happens.The release, which Anthropic describes as a "research preview," is the AI safety company's latest move to embed its technology deeper into enterprise workflows — and comes as Claude Code has emerged as a surprise revenue engine, generating over $1 billion in annualized revenue just six months after its public debut in May."The critical context around engineering work often lives in Slack, including bug reports, feature requests, and engineering discussion," the company wrote in its announcement blog post. "When a bug report appears or a teammate needs a code fix, you can now tag Claude in Slack to automatically spin up a Claude Code session using the surrounding context."From bug report to pull request: how the new Slack integration actually worksThe mechanics are deceptively simple but address a persistent friction point in software development: the gap between where problems get discussed and where they get fixed.When a user mentions @Claude in a Slack channel or thread, Claude analyzes the message to determine whether it constitutes a coding task. If it does, the system automatically creates a new Claude Code session. Users can also explicitly instruct Claude to treat requests as coding tasks.Claude gathers context from recent channel and thread messages in Slack to feed into the Claude Code session. It will use this context to automatically choose which repository to run the task on based on the repositories you've authenticated to Claude Code on the web.As the Claude Code session progresses, Claude posts status updates back to the Slack thread. Once complete, users receive a link to the full session where they can review changes, along with a direct link to open a pull request.The feature builds on Anthropic's existing Claude for Slack integration and requires users to have access to Claude Code on the web. In practical terms, a product manager reporting a bug in Slack could tag Claude, which would then analyze the conversation context, identify the relevant code repository, investigate the issue, propose a fix, and post a pull request—all while updating the original Slack thread with its progress.Why Anthropic is betting big on enterprise workflow integrationsThe Slack integration arrives at a pivotal moment for Anthropic. Claude Code has already hit $1 billion in revenue six months since its public debut in May, according to a LinkedIn post from Anthropic's chief product officer, Mike Krieger. The coding agent continues to barrel toward scale with customers like Netflix, Spotify, and Salesforce.The velocity of that growth helps explain why Anthropic made its first-ever acquisition earlier this month. Anthropic declined to comment on financial details. The Information earlier reported on Anthropic's bid to acquire Bun.Bun is a breakthrough JavaScript runtime that is dramatically faster than the leading competition. As an all-in-one toolkit — combining runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner — it's become essential infrastructure for AI-led software engineering, helping developers build and test applications at unprecedented velocity.Since becoming generally available in May 2025, Claude Code has grown from its origins as an internal engineering experiment into a critical tool for many of the world's category-leading enterprises, including Netflix, Spotify, KPMG, L'Oreal, and Salesforce — and Bun has been key in helping scale its infrastructure throughout that evolution.The acquisition signals that Anthropic views Claude Code not as a peripheral feature but as a core business line worth substantial investment. The Slack integration extends that bet, positioning Claude Code as an ambient presence in the workspaces where engineering decisions actually get made.According to an Anthropic spokesperson, companies including Rakuten, Novo Nordisk, Uber, Snowflake, and Ramp now use Claude Code for both professional and novice developers. Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant, has reportedly reduced software development timelines from 24 days to just 5 days using the tool — a 79% reduction that illustrates the productivity claims Anthropic has been making.Claude Code's rapid rise from internal experiment to billion-dollar productThe Slack launch is the latest in a rapid series of Claude Code expansions. In late November, Claude Code was added to Anthropic's desktop apps including the Mac version. Claude Code was previously limited to mobile apps and the web. It allows software engineers to code, research, and update work with multiple local and remote sessions running at the same time.That release accompanied Anthropic's unveiling of Claude Opus 4.5, its newest and most capable model. Claude Opus 4.5 is available today on the company's apps, API, and on all three major cloud platforms. Pricing is $5/$25 per million tokens — making Opus-level capabilities accessible to even more users, teams, and enterprises.The company has also invested heavily in the developer infrastructure that powers Claude Code. In late November, Anthropic released three new beta features for tool use: Tool Search Tool, which allows Claude to use search tools to access thousands of tools without consuming its context window; Programmatic Tool Calling, which allows Claude to invoke tools in a code execution environment reducing the impact on the model's context window; and Tool Use Examples, which provides a universal standard for demonstrating how to effectively use a given tool.The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI agents to external systems. Connecting agents to tools and data traditionally requires a custom integration for each pairing, creating fragmentation and duplicated effort that makes it difficult to scale truly connected systems. MCP provides a universal protocol — developers implement MCP once in their agent and it unlocks an entire ecosystem of integrations.Inside Anthropic's own AI transformation: what happens when engineers use Claude all dayAnthropic has been unusually transparent about how its own engineers use Claude Code — and the findings offer a preview of broader workforce implications. In August 2025, Anthropic surveyed 132 engineers and researchers, conducted 53 in-depth qualitative interviews, and studied internal Claude Code usage data to understand how AI use is changing work at the company.Employees self-reported using Claude in 60% of their work and achieving a 50% productivity boost, a 2-3x increase from this time last year. This productivity looks like slightly less time per task category, but considerably more output volume.Perhaps most notably, 27% of Claude-assisted work consists of tasks that wouldn't have been done otherwise, such as scaling projects, making nice-to-have tools like interactive data dashboards, and exploratory work that wouldn't be cost-effective if done manually.The internal research also revealed how Claude is changing the nature of engineering collaboration. The maximum number of consecutive tool calls Claude Code makes per transcript increased by 116%. Claude now chains together 21.2 independent tool calls without need for human intervention versus 9.8 tool calls from six months ago.The number of human turns decreased by 33%. The average number of human turns decreased from 6.2 to 4.1 per transcript, suggesting that less human input is necessary to accomplish a given task now compared to six months ago.But the research also surfaced tensions. One prominent theme was that Claude has become the first stop for questions that once went to colleagues. "It has reduced my dependence on [my team] by 80%, [but] the last 20% is crucial and I go and talk to them," one engineer explained. Several engineers said they "bounce ideas off" Claude, similar to interactions with human collaborators.Others described experiencing less interaction with colleagues. Some appreciate the reduced social friction, but others resist the change or miss the older way of working: "I like working with people and it is sad that I 'need' them less now."How Anthropic stacks up against OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft in the enterprise AI raceAnthropic is not alone in racing to capture the enterprise coding market. OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft (through GitHub Copilot) are all pursuing similar integrations. The Slack launch gives Anthropic a presence in one of the most widely-used enterprise communication platforms — Slack claims over 750,000 organizations use its software.The deal comes as Anthropic pursues a more disciplined growth path than rival OpenAI, focusing on enterprise customers and coding workloads. Internal financials reported by The Wall Street Journal show Anthropic expects to break even by 2028 — two years earlier than OpenAI, which continues to invest heavily in infrastructure as it expands into video, hardware, and consumer products.The move also marks an increased push into developer tooling. Anthropic has recently seen backing from some of tech's biggest titans. Microsoft and Nvidia pledged up to $15 billion in fresh investment in Anthropic last month, alongside a $30 billion commitment from Anthropic to run Claude Code on Microsoft's cloud. This is in addition to the $8 billion invested from Amazon and $3 billion from Google.The cross-investment from both Microsoft and Google — fierce competitors in the cloud and AI spaces — highlights how valuable Anthropic's enterprise positioning has become. By integrating with Slack (which is owned by Salesforce), Anthropic further embeds itself in the enterprise software ecosystem while remaining platform-agnostic.What the Slack integration means for developers — and whether they can trust itFor engineering teams, the Slack integration promises to collapse the distance between problem identification and problem resolution. A bug report in a Slack channel can immediately trigger investigation. A feature request can spawn a prototype. A code review comment can generate a refactor.But the integration also raises questions about oversight and code quality. Most Anthropic employees use Claude frequently while reporting they can "fully delegate" only 0-20% of their work to it. Claude is a constant collaborator but using it generally involves active supervision and validation, especially in high-stakes work — versus handing off tasks requiring no verification at all.Some employees are concerned about the atrophy of deeper skillsets required for both writing and critiquing code — "When producing output is so easy and fast, it gets harder and harder to actually take the time to learn something."The Slack integration, by making Claude Code invocation as simple as an @mention, may accelerate both the productivity benefits and the skill-atrophy concerns that Anthropic's own research has documented.The future of coding may be conversational—and Anthropic is racing to prove itThe beta launch marks the beginning of what Anthropic expects will be a broader rollout, with documentation forthcoming for teams looking to deploy the integration and refinements planned based on user feedback during the research preview phase.For Anthropic, the Slack integration is a calculated bet on a fundamental shift in how software gets written. The company is wagering that the future of coding will be conversational — that the walls between where developers talk about problems and where they solve them will dissolve entirely. The companies that win enterprise AI, in this view, will be the ones that meet developers not in specialized tools but in the chat windows they already have open all day.Whether that vision becomes reality will depend on whether Claude Code can deliver enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining the security that organizations demand. The early returns are promising: a billion dollars in revenue, a roster of Fortune 500 customers, and a growing ecosystem of integrations suggest Anthropic is onto something real.But in one of Anthropic's own internal interviews, an engineer offered a more cautious assessment of the transformation underway: "Nobody knows what's going to happen… the important thing is to just be really adaptable."In the age of AI coding agents, that may be the only career advice that holds up.

- [Booking.com’s agent strategy: Disciplined, modular and already delivering 2× accuracy](https://venturebeat.com/ai/booking-coms-agent-strategy-disciplined-modular-and-already-delivering-2) — 07:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > When many enterprises weren’t even thinking about agentic behaviors or infrastructures, Booking.com had already “stumbled” into them with its homegrown conversational recommendation system. 

This early experimentation has allowed the company to take a step back and avoid getting swept up in the frantic AI agent hype. Instead, it is taking a disciplined, layered, modular approach to model development: small, travel-specific models for cheap, fast inference; larger large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and understanding; and domain-tuned evaluations built in-house when precision is critical. 

With this hybrid strategy — combined with selective collaboration with OpenAI — Booking.com has seen accuracy double across key retrieval, ranking and customer-interaction tasks.

As Pranav Pathak, Booking.com’s AI product development lead, posed to VentureBeat in a new podcast: “Do you build it very, very specialized and bespoke and then have an army of a hundred agents? Or do you keep it general enough and have five agents that are good at generalized tasks, but then you have to orchestrate a lot around them? That's a balance that I think we're still trying to figure out, as is the rest of the industry.”

Check out the new Beyond the Pilot podcast here, and continue reading for highlights. Moving from guessing to deep personalization without being ‘creepy’Recommendation systems are core to Booking.com’s customer-facing platforms; however, traditional recommendation tools have been less about recommendation and more about guessing, Pathak conceded. So, from the start, he and his team vowed to avoid generic tools: As he put it, the price and recommendation should be based on customer context. 

Booking.com’s initial pre-gen AI tooling for intent and topic detection was a small language model, what Pathak described as “the scale and size of BERT.” The model ingested the customer’s inputs around their problem to determine whether it could be solved through self-service or bumped to a human agent. 

“We started with an architecture of ‘you have to call a tool if this is the intent you detect and this is how you've parsed the structure,” Pathak explained. “That was very, very similar to the first few agentic architectures that came out in terms of reason and defining a tool call.” 

His team has since built out that architecture to include an LLM orchestrator that classifies queries, triggers retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and calls APIs or smaller, specialized language models. “We've been able to scale that system quite well because it was so close in architecture that, with a few tweaks, we now have a full agentic stack,” said Pathak. 

As a result, Booking.com is seeing a 2X increase in topic detection, which in turn is freeing up human agents’ bandwidth by 1.5 to 1.7X. More topics, even complicated ones previously identified as ‘other’ and requiring escalation, are being automated. 

Ultimately, this supports more self-service, freeing human agents to focus on customers with uniquely-specific problems that the platform doesn’t have a dedicated tool flow for — say, a family that is unable to access its hotel room at 2 a.m. when the front desk is closed. 

That not only “really starts to compound,” but has a direct, long-term impact on customer retention, Pathak noted. “One of the things we've seen is, the better we are at customer service, the more loyal our customers are.”

Another recent rollout is personalized filtering. Booking.com has between 200 and 250 search filters on its website — an unrealistic amount for any human to sift through, Pathak pointed out. So, his team introduced a free text box that users can type into to immediately receive tailored filters. 

“That becomes such an important cue for personalization in terms of what you're looking for in your own words rather than a clickstream,” said Pathak. 

In turn, it cues Booking.com into what customers actually want. For instance, hot tubs — when filter personalization first rolled out, jacuzzi’s were one of the most popular requests. That wasn’t even a consideration previously; there wasn’t even a filter. Now that filter is live. 

“I had no idea,” Pathak noted. “I had never searched for a hot tub in my room honestly.”

When it comes to personalization, though, there is a fine line; memory remains complicated, Pathak emphasized. While it’s important to have long-term memories and evolving threads with customers — retaining information like their typical budgets, preferred hotel star ratings or whether they need disability access — it must be on their terms and protective of their privacy. 

Booking.com is extremely mindful with memory, seeking consent so as to not be “creepy” when collecting customer information. 

“Managing memory is much harder than actually building memory,” said Pathak. “The tech is out there, we have the technical chops to build it. We want to make sure we don't launch a memory object that doesn't respect customer consent, that doesn't feel very natural.”Finding a balance of build versus buy
As agents mature, Booking.com is navigating a central question facing the entire industry: How narrow should agents become? 

Instead of committing to either a swarm of highly specialized agents or a few generalized ones, the company aims for reversible decisions and avoids “one-way doors” that lock its architecture into long-term, costly paths. Pathak’s strategy is: Generalize where possible, specialize where necessary and keep agent design flexible to help ensure resiliency. 

Pathak and his team are “very mindful” of use cases, evaluating where to build more generalized, reusable agents or more task-specific ones. They strive to use the smallest model possible, with the highest level of accuracy and output quality, for each use case. Whatever can be generalized is. 

Latency is another important consideration. When factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations is paramount, his team will use a larger, much slower model; but with search and recommendations, user expectations set speed. (Pathak noted: “No one’s patient.”)

“We would, for example, never use something as heavy as GPT-5 for just topic detection or for entity extraction,” he said. 

Booking.com takes a similarly elastic tack when it comes to monitoring and evaluations: If it's general-purpose monitoring that someone else is better at building and has horizontal capability, they’ll buy it. But if it’s instances where brand guidelines must be enforced, they’ll build their own evals. 

Ultimately, Booking.com has leaned into being “super anticipatory,” agile and flexible. “At this point with everything that's happening with AI, we are a little bit averse to walking through one way doors,” said Pathak. “We want as many of our decisions to be reversible as possible. We don't want to get locked into a decision that we cannot reverse two years from now.”What other builders can learn from Booking.com’s AI journeyBooking.com’s AI journey can serve as an important blueprint for other enterprises. 

Looking back, Pathak acknowledged that they started out with a “pretty complicated” tech stack. They’re now in a good place with that, “but we probably could have started something much simpler and seen how customers interacted with it.”

Given that, he offered this valuable advice: If you’re just starting out with LLMs or agents, out-of-the-box APIs will do just fine. “There's enough customization with APIs that you can already get a lot of leverage before you decide you want to go do more.” 

On the other hand, if a use case requires customization not available through a standard API call, that makes a case for in-house tools. 

Still, he emphasized: Don't start with the complicated stuff. Tackle the “simplest, most painful problem you can find and the simplest, most obvious solution to that.” 

Identify the product market fit, then investigate the ecosystems, he advised — but don’t just rip out old infrastructures because a new use case demands something specific (like moving an entire cloud strategy from AWS to Azure just to use the OpenAI endpoint). 

Ultimately: “Don't lock yourself in too early,” Pathak noted. “Don't make decisions that are one-way doors until you are very confident that that's the solution that you want to go with.”

- [Design in the age of AI: How small businesses are building big brands faster](https://venturebeat.com/ai/design-in-the-age-of-ai-how-small-businesses-are-building-big-brands-faster) — 00:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > Presented by Design.comFor most of history, design was the last step in starting a business — something entrepreneurs invested in once the idea was proven. Today, it’s one of the first. The rise of generative AI has shifted how small businesses imagine, launch, and grow — turning what used to be a months-long creative process into something interactive, iterative, and accessible from day one.Search data tells the story. Since 2022, global interest in “AI business name generator” has surged more than 700%. Searches for “AI logo generator” are up 1,200%, and “AI website generator” 1,600%. Small businesses aren’t waiting for enterprise AI trickle-down. They’re adopting these tools en masse to move faster from concept to brand identity.“The appetite for AI-powered design has been extraordinary,” says Alec Lynch, founder and CEO of Design.com. “Entrepreneurs are realizing they can bring their ideas to life immediately — they don’t have to wait for funding, agencies, or a full creative team. They can start now.”The democratization of design powerFor decades, small businesses were boxed out of high-end design. Building a brand required deep pockets and specialized talent. AI has redrawn that map.Large language models and image generators now act as collaborative partners — sparking ideas, testing directions, and handling tedious layout and copy work. For founders, that means fewer barriers and faster iteration.Instead of hiring separate agencies for naming, logo design, and web development, small businesses are turning to unified AI platforms that handle the full early-stage design stack. Tools like Design.com merge naming, logo creation, and website generation into a single workflow — turning an entrepreneur’s first sketch into a polished brand system within minutes.“AI isn’t replacing creativity,” Lynch adds. “It’s giving people the confidence to express it.”The five frontiers of AI-powered entrepreneurshipToday’s AI tools mirror the creative journey every founder takes — from naming a business to sharing it with the world. The five fastest-growing design categories on Google reflect each stage of that journey.1. Naming: From idea to identityAI naming tools do more than spit out clever words — they help founders discover their voice. A good generator blends tone, personality, and domain availability so the result feels like a fit, not a random suggestion.2. Logos: From visuals to meaningLogo creation is one of the most emotionally resonant steps in brand-building. AI has turned it into a playground for experimentation. Entrepreneurs can test dozens of looks and get instant feedback.3. Websites: From static pages to adaptive brandsThe surge in “AI website generator” searches signals a deeper shift. Websites are no longer static brochures; they’re dynamic brand environments. AI-driven builders now create layouts, headlines, and imagery that adapt to a company’s tone and focus — drastically reducing time to launch.4. Business cards and brand collateralEven in a digital age, tangible touchpoints matter. AI-generated business cards give founders an immediate sense of legitimacy while ensuring design consistency across brand assets.5. Presentations: From slides to storytellingFounders aren’t just designing assets; they’re designing narratives. Generative AI turns bullet points into persuasive visual stories — raising the quality of pitches, decks, and demos once out of reach for most small teams.Together, these five frontiers show that small businesses aren’t just using AI to look more polished — they’re using it to think more strategically about brand, story, and customer experience from the start.The new design ecosystemBehind the surge in AI design tools lies a broader ecosystem shift. Companies like Canva and Wix made design accessible; the current wave — led by AI-native platforms like Design.com — is more personal and adaptive.Unlike templated platforms, these tools understand context. A restaurant founder and a SaaS startup will get not just different visuals, but different copy tones, typography systems, and user flows — automatically.“What we’re seeing,” Lynch explains, “isn’t just growth in one product category. It’s a movement toward connected creativity — where every part of the brand experience learns from every other.”From AI tools to AI brand systemsThe next evolution of small-business design won’t be about single-purpose tools. It will be about connected systems that share data, context, and creative intent across every brand touchpoint.Imagine naming a company and watching an AI instantly generate a logo, color palette, and homepage layout that all reflect the same personality. As your audience grows, the same system helps you update your visual identity or tone to match new goals — while preserving your original DNA.That’s the future Design.com and others are building toward: intelligent brand ecosystems that evolve alongside their founders.“AI design tools are giving small businesses superpowers,” Lynch says. “They’re removing friction from creativity.”And that frictionless design process is quietly rewriting what entrepreneurship looks like. The ability to create, iterate, and launch in hours instead of months is changing the tempo of business itself — and redefining what it means to be a designer in the age of AI.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.
