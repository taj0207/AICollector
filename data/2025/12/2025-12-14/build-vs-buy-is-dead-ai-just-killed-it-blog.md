# The End of Build vs. Buy: How AI is Redefining Software Development

In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, the age-old debate of whether to build software in-house or buy off-the-shelf solutions is undergoing a seismic shift. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has fundamentally altered the dynamics of this decision-making process. What was once a straightforward choice—build if it’s core to your business and buy if it isn’t—has now become a complex interplay of capabilities and insights.

## The Traditional Framework

For decades, companies faced a clear dilemma: should they invest in building custom software, which often required significant resources, or should they purchase existing solutions, which promised quicker deployment and support? Building software meant navigating a labyrinth of engineering challenges, from writing specifications to managing infrastructure and ongoing maintenance. On the other hand, buying software was seen as a safer, faster route, albeit often at a high cost.

However, as AI technologies have matured, this framework has begun to crumble. The once daunting task of building software is now accessible to a broader range of employees, including those without technical backgrounds. This democratization of software development is changing everything.

## The Democratization of Development

Imagine sitting in a meeting, ready to approve a vendor's proposal, when a finance team member casually mentions they built a working prototype in just two hours using AI tools like Cursor. This scenario is becoming increasingly common, highlighting a critical shift in how software is developed. Non-technical employees can now create functional applications that address specific business needs, often at a fraction of the cost and time.

This newfound capability allows companies to experiment and iterate quickly. Instead of waiting for weeks or months for engineering teams to deliver a solution, teams can now prototype their ideas and validate them in real-time. This not only accelerates the development cycle but also ensures that the solutions being built are genuinely aligned with the organization’s needs.

## Understanding Real Needs

One of the most significant advantages of this shift is the ability to understand what a company truly needs before making a purchase. In the past, defining needs often required deep technical expertise and extensive trial-and-error with various vendors. This process was fraught with risks, as companies frequently ended up investing in solutions that didn’t effectively address their actual problems.

Now, teams can leverage AI to build lightweight prototypes that clarify their requirements. By experimenting with these prototypes, they can identify which features deliver real value and which are merely attractive in demos. This iterative approach transforms the vendor selection process from a guessing game into a strategic decision grounded in firsthand experience.

## The New Decision-Making Paradigm

With this shift, the traditional sequence of decision-making has been inverted. Instead of defining a need and then deciding whether to build or buy, organizations can now build first to learn what they need. This approach allows for controlled experiments that reveal whether a problem is worth solving and what features are essential.

When it comes time to purchase, the questions change dramatically. Instead of asking, “Does this software meet our needs?” the inquiry becomes, “Does this solution outperform what we’ve already built?” This reframe empowers teams to negotiate from a position of strength, armed with knowledge and clarity about their requirements.

## Avoiding the AI Trap

Despite the clear advantages of this new paradigm, many companies are at risk of falling into the trap of merely adopting AI for the sake of it. In their haste to become AI-native, organizations may purchase tools that lack genuine value or fail to transform how work gets done. This phenomenon mirrors what physicist Richard Feynman referred to as “cargo cult science,” where the superficial adoption of practices does not lead to meaningful outcomes.

To avoid this pitfall, companies must critically assess whether the AI tools they are considering will truly enhance their operations and empower their teams. The goal should be to integrate AI in ways that unlock new processes and capabilities, rather than simply adding features for the sake of appearances.

## Conclusion: Embracing the Future

The implications of this shift are profound. Companies that embrace the new paradigm of building to learn will not only move faster but will also make smarter purchasing decisions. They will gain a deeper understanding of their operations, leading to fewer costly mistakes and better tools that genuinely meet their needs.

As the landscape continues to evolve, organizations that cling to outdated frameworks will find themselves at a disadvantage. The future belongs to those who recognize that the lines between technical and non-technical roles are blurring, and that the key to success lies in leveraging AI to empower all employees to contribute to software development. In this new era, the rules have indeed changed for good.
