  > Zoom Video Communications, the company best known for keeping remote workers connected during the pandemic, announced last week that it had achieved the highest score ever recorded on one of artificial intelligence's most demanding tests — a claim that sent ripples of surprise, skepticism, and genuine curiosity through the technology industry.The San Jose-based company said its AI system scored 48.1 percent on the Humanity's Last Exam, a benchmark designed by subject-matter experts worldwide to stump even the most advanced AI models. That result edges out Google's Gemini 3 Pro, which held the previous record at 45.8 percent."Zoom has achieved a new state-of-the-art result on the challenging Humanity's Last Exam full-set benchmark, scoring 48.1%, which represents a substantial 2.3% improvement over the previous SOTA result," wrote Xuedong Huang, Zoom's chief technology officer, in a blog post.The announcement raises a provocative question that has consumed AI watchers for days: How did a video conferencing company — one with no public history of training large language models — suddenly vault past Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic on a benchmark built to measure the frontiers of machine intelligence?The answer reveals as much about where AI is headed as it does about Zoom's own technical ambitions. And depending on whom you ask, it's either an ingenious demonstration of practical engineering or a hollow claim that appropriates credit for others' work.How Zoom built an AI traffic controller instead of training its own modelZoom did not train its own large language model. Instead, the company developed what it calls a "federated AI approach" — a system that routes queries to multiple existing models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, then uses proprietary software to select, combine, and refine their outputs.At the heart of this system sits what Zoom calls its "Z-scorer," a mechanism that evaluates responses from different models and chooses the best one for any given task. The company pairs this with what it describes as an "explore-verify-federate strategy," an agentic workflow that balances exploratory reasoning with verification across multiple AI systems."Our federated approach combines Zoom's own small language models with advanced open-source and closed-source models," Huang wrote. The framework "orchestrates diverse models to generate, challenge, and refine reasoning through dialectical collaboration."In simpler terms: Zoom built a sophisticated traffic controller for AI, not the AI itself.This distinction matters enormously in an industry where bragging rights — and billions in valuation — often hinge on who can claim the most capable model. The major AI laboratories spend hundreds of millions of dollars training frontier systems on vast computing clusters. Zoom's achievement, by contrast, appears to rest on clever integration of those existing systems.Why AI researchers are divided over what counts as real innovationThe response from the AI community was swift and sharply divided.Max Rumpf, an AI engineer who says he has trained state-of-the-art language models, posted a pointed critique on social media. "Zoom strung together API calls to Gemini, GPT, Claude et al. and slightly improved on a benchmark that delivers no value for their customers," he wrote. "They then claim SOTA."Rumpf did not dismiss the technical approach itself. Using multiple models for different tasks, he noted, is "actually quite smart and most applications should do this." He pointed to Sierra, an AI customer service company, as an example of this multi-model strategy executed effectively.His objection was more specific: "They did not train the model, but obfuscate this fact in the tweet. The injustice of taking credit for the work of others sits deeply with people."But other observers saw the achievement differently. Hongcheng Zhu, a developer, offered a more measured assessment: "To top an AI eval, you will most likely need model federation, like what Zoom did. An analogy is that every Kaggle competitor knows you have to ensemble models to win a contest."The comparison to Kaggle — the competitive data science platform where combining multiple models is standard practice among winning teams — reframes Zoom's approach as industry best practice rather than sleight of hand. Academic research has long established that ensemble methods routinely outperform individual models.Still, the debate exposed a fault line in how the industry understands progress. Ryan Pream, founder of Exoria AI, was dismissive: "Zoom are just creating a harness around another LLM and reporting that. It is just noise." Another commenter captured the sheer unexpectedness of the news: "That the video conferencing app ZOOM developed a SOTA model that achieved 48% HLE was not on my bingo card."Perhaps the most pointed critique concerned priorities. Rumpf argued that Zoom could have directed its resources toward problems its customers actually face. "Retrieval over call transcripts is not 'solved' by SOTA LLMs," he wrote. "I figure Zoom's users would care about this much more than HLE."The Microsoft veteran betting his reputation on a different kind of AIIf Zoom's benchmark result seemed to come from nowhere, its chief technology officer did not.Xuedong Huang joined Zoom from Microsoft, where he spent decades building the company's AI capabilities. He founded Microsoft's speech technology group in 1993 and led teams that achieved what the company described as human parity in speech recognition, machine translation, natural language understanding, and computer vision.Huang holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Edinburgh. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as a fellow of both the IEEE and the ACM. His credentials place him among the most accomplished AI executives in the industry.His presence at Zoom signals that the company's AI ambitions are serious, even if its methods differ from the research laboratories that dominate headlines. In his tweet celebrating the benchmark result, Huang framed the achievement as validation of Zoom's strategy: "We have unlocked stronger capabilities in exploration, reasoning, and multi-model collaboration, surpassing the performance limits of any single model."That final clause — "surpassing the performance limits of any single model" — may be the most significant. Huang is not claiming Zoom built a better model. He is claiming Zoom built a better system for using models.Inside the test designed to stump the world's smartest machinesThe benchmark at the center of this controversy, Humanity's Last Exam, was designed to be exceptionally difficult. Unlike earlier tests that AI systems learned to game through pattern matching, HLE presents problems that require genuine understanding, multi-step reasoning, and the synthesis of information across complex domains.The exam draws on questions from experts around the world, spanning fields from advanced mathematics to philosophy to specialized scientific knowledge. A score of 48.1 percent might sound unimpressive to anyone accustomed to school grading curves, but in the context of HLE, it represents the current ceiling of machine performance."This benchmark was developed by subject-matter experts globally and has become a crucial metric for measuring AI's progress toward human-level performance on challenging intellectual tasks," Zoom’s announcement noted.The company's improvement of 2.3 percentage points over Google's previous best may appear modest in isolation. But in competitive benchmarking, where gains often come in fractions of a percent, such a jump commands attention.What Zoom's approach reveals about the future of enterprise AIZoom's approach carries implications that extend well beyond benchmark leaderboards. The company is signaling a vision for enterprise AI that differs fundamentally from the model-centric strategies pursued by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.Rather than betting everything on building the single most capable model, Zoom is positioning itself as an orchestration layer — a company that can integrate the best capabilities from multiple providers and deliver them through products that businesses already use every day.This strategy hedges against a critical uncertainty in the AI market: no one knows which model will be best next month, let alone next year. By building infrastructure that can swap between providers, Zoom avoids vendor lock-in while theoretically offering customers the best available AI for any given task.The announcement of OpenAI's GPT-5.2 the following day underscored this dynamic. OpenAI's own communications named Zoom as a partner that had evaluated the new model's performance "across their AI workloads and saw measurable gains across the board." Zoom, in other words, is both a customer of the frontier labs and now a competitor on their benchmarks — using their own technology.This arrangement may prove sustainable. The major model providers have every incentive to sell API access widely, even to companies that might aggregate their outputs. The more interesting question is whether Zoom's orchestration capabilities constitute genuine intellectual property or merely sophisticated prompt engineering that others could replicate.The real test arrives when Zoom's 300 million users start asking questionsZoom titled its announcement section on industry relations "A Collaborative Future," and Huang struck notes of gratitude throughout. "The future of AI is collaborative, not competitive," he wrote. "By combining the best innovations from across the industry with our own research breakthroughs, we create solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts."This framing positions Zoom as a beneficent integrator, bringing together the industry's best work for the benefit of enterprise customers. Critics see something else: a company claiming the prestige of an AI laboratory without doing the foundational research that earns it.The debate will likely be settled not by leaderboards but by products. When AI Companion 3.0 reaches Zoom's hundreds of millions of users in the coming months, they will render their own verdict — not on benchmarks they have never heard of, but on whether the meeting summary actually captured what mattered, whether the action items made sense, whether the AI saved them time or wasted it.In the end, Zoom's most provocative claim may not be that it topped a benchmark. It may be the implicit argument that in the age of AI, the best model is not the one you build — it's the one you know how to use.
- [Zencoder drops Zenflow, a free AI orchestration tool that pits Claude against OpenAI’s models to catch coding errors](https://venturebeat.com/ai/zencoder-drops-zenflow-a-free-ai-orchestration-tool-that-pits-claude-against) — 06:00 · VentureBeat AI
  > Zencoder, the Silicon Valley startup that builds AI-powered coding agents, released a free desktop application on Monday that it says will fundamentally change how software engineers interact with artificial intelligence — moving the industry beyond the freewheeling era of "vibe coding" toward a more disciplined, verifiable approach to AI-assisted development.The product, called Zenflow, introduces what the company describes as an "AI orchestration layer" that coordinates multiple AI agents to plan, implement, test, and review code in structured workflows. The launch is Zencoder's most ambitious attempt yet to differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded market dominated by tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and coding agents built directly by AI giants Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google."Chat UIs were fine for copilots, but they break down when you try to scale," said Andrew Filev, Zencoder's chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. "Teams are hitting a wall where speed without structure creates technical debt. Zenflow replaces 'Prompt Roulette' with an engineering assembly line where agents plan, implement, and, crucially, verify each other's work."The announcement arrives at a critical moment for enterprise software development. Companies across industries have poured billions of dollars into AI coding tools over the past two years, hoping to dramatically accelerate their engineering output. Yet the promised productivity revolution has largely failed to materialize at scale.Why AI coding tools have failed to deliver on their 10x productivity promiseFilev, who previously founded and sold the project management company Wrike to Citrix, pointed to a growing disconnect between AI coding hype and reality. While vendors have promised tenfold productivity gains, rigorous studies — including research from Stanford University — consistently show improvements closer to 20 percent."If you talk to real engineering leaders, I don't remember a single conversation where somebody vibe coded themselves to 2x or 5x or 10x productivity on serious engineering production," Filev said. "The typical number you would hear would be about 20 percent."The problem, according to Filev, lies not with the AI models themselves but with how developers interact with them. The standard approach of typing requests into a chat interface and hoping for usable code works well for simple tasks but falls apart on complex enterprise projects.Zencoder's internal engineering team claims to have cracked a different approach. Filev said the company now operates at roughly twice the velocity it achieved 12 months ago, not primarily because AI models improved, but because the team restructured its development processes."We had to change our process and use a variety of different best practices," he said.Inside the four pillars that power Zencoder's AI orchestration platformZenflow organizes its approach around four core capabilities that Zencoder argues any serious AI orchestration platform must support.Structured workflows replace ad-hoc prompting with repeatable sequences (plan, implement, test, review) that agents follow consistently. Filev drew parallels to his experience building Wrike, noting that individual to-do lists rarely scale across organizations, while defined workflows create predictable outcomes.Spec-driven development requires AI agents to first generate a technical specification, then create a step-by-step plan, and only then write code. The approach became so effective that frontier AI labs including Anthropic and OpenAI have since trained their models to follow it automatically. The specification anchors agents to clear requirements, preventing what Zencoder calls "iteration drift," or the tendency for AI-generated code to gradually diverge from the original intent.Multi-agent verification deploys different AI models to critique each other's work. Because AI models from the same family tend to share blind spots, Zencoder routes verification tasks across model providers, asking Claude to review code written by OpenAI's models, or vice versa."Think of it as a second opinion from a doctor," Filev told VentureBeat. "With the right pipeline, we see results on par with what you'd expect from Claude 5 or GPT-6. You're getting the benefit of a next-generation model today."Parallel execution lets developers run multiple AI agents simultaneously in isolated sandboxes, preventing them from interfering with each other's work. The interface provides a command center for monitoring this fleet, a significant departure from the current practice of managing multiple terminal windows.How verification solves AI coding's biggest reliability problemZencoder's emphasis on verification addresses one of the most persistent criticisms of AI-generated code: its tendency to produce "slop," or code that appears correct but fails in production or degrades over successive iterations.The company's internal research found that developers who skip verification often fall into what Filev called a "death loop." An AI agent completes a task successfully, but the developer, reluctant to review unfamiliar code, moves on without understanding what was written. When subsequent tasks fail, the developer lacks the context to fix problems manually and instead keeps prompting the AI for solutions."They literally spend more than a day in that death loop," Filev said. "That's why the productivity is not 2x, because they were running at 3x first, and then they wasted the whole day."The multi-agent verification approach also gives Zencoder an unusual competitive advantage over the frontier AI labs themselves. While Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google each optimize their own models, Zencoder can mix and match across providers to reduce bias."This is a rare situation where we have an edge on the frontier labs," Filev said. "Most of the time they have an edge on us, but this is a rare case."Zencoder faces steep competition from AI giants and well-funded startupsZencoder enters the AI orchestration market at a moment of intense competition. The company has positioned itself as a model-agnostic platform, supporting major providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini. In September, Zencoder expanded its platform to let developers use command-line coding agents from any provider within its interface.That strategy reflects a pragmatic acknowledgment that developers increasingly maintain relationships with multiple AI providers rather than committing exclusively to one. Zencoder's universal platform approach lets it serve as the orchestration layer regardless of which underlying models a company prefers.The company also emphasizes enterprise readiness, touting SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and ISO 42001 certifications along with GDPR compliance. These credentials matter for regulated industries like financial services and healthcare, where compliance requirements can block adoption of consumer-oriented AI tools.But Zencoder faces formidable competition from multiple directions. Cursor and Windsurf have built dedicated AI-first code editors with devoted user bases. GitHub Copilot benefits from Microsoft's distribution muscle and deep integration with the world's largest code repository. And the frontier AI labs continue expanding their own coding capabilities.Filev dismissed concerns about competition from the AI labs, arguing that smaller players like Zencoder can move faster on user experience innovation."I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion, and they're smart and moving fast, so I'm sure they will catch up fairly quickly," he said. "That's why I said in the next six to 12 months, you're going to see a lot of this propagating through the whole space."The case for adopting AI orchestration now instead of waiting for better modelsTechnical executives weighing AI coding investments face a difficult timing question: Should they adopt orchestration tools now, or wait for frontier AI labs to build these capabilities natively into their models?Filev argued that waiting carries significant competitive risk."Right now, everybody is under pressure to deliver more in less time, and everybody expects engineering leaders to deliver results from AI," he said. "As a founder and CEO, I do not expect 20 percent from my VP of engineering. I expect 2x."He also questioned whether the major AI labs will prioritize orchestration capabilities when their core business remains model development."In the ideal world, frontier labs should be building the best-ever models and competing with each other, and Zencoders and Cursors need to build the best-ever UI and UX application layer on top of those models," Filev said. "I don't see a world where OpenAI will offer you our code verifier, or vice versa."Zenflow launches as a free desktop application, with updated plugins available for Visual Studio Code and JetBrains integrated development environments. The product supports what Zencoder calls "dynamic workflows," meaning the system automatically adjusts process complexity based on whether a human is actively monitoring and on the difficulty of the task at hand.Zencoder said internal testing showed that replacing standard prompting with Zenflow's orchestration layer improved code correctness by approximately 20 percent on average.What Zencoder's bet on orchestration reveals about the future of AI codingZencoder frames Zenflow as the first product in what it expects to become a significant new software category. The company believes every vendor focused on AI coding will eventually arrive at similar conclusions about the need for orchestration tools."I think the next six to 12 months will be all about orchestration," Filev predicted. "A lot of organizations will finally reach that 2x. Not 10x yet, but at least the 2x they were promised a year ago."Rather than competing head-to-head with frontier AI labs on model quality, Zencoder is betting that the application layer (the software that helps developers actually use these models effectively) will determine winners and losers.It is, Filev suggested, a familiar pattern from technology history."This is very similar to what I observed when I started Wrike," he said. "As work went digital, people relied on email and spreadsheets to manage everything, and neither could keep up."The same dynamic, he argued, now applies to AI coding. Chat interfaces were designed for conversation, not for orchestrating complex engineering workflows. Whether Zencoder can establish itself as the essential layer between developers and AI models before the giants build their own solutions remains an open question.But Filev seems comfortable with the race. The last time he spotted a gap between how people worked and the tools they had to work with, he built a company worth over a billion dollars.Zenflow is available immediately as a free download at zencoder.ai/zenflow.
