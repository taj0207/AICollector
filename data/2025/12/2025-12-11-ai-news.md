- [GPT-5.2 first impressions: a powerful update, especially for business tasks and workflows](https://venturebeat.com/ai/gpt-5-2-first-impressions-a-powerful-update-especially-for-business-tasks) — 15:26 · VentureBeat AI
  > OpenAI has officially released GPT-5.2, and the reactions from early testers — among whom OpenAI seeded the model several days prior to public release, in some cases weeks ago — paints a two toned picture: it is a monumental leap forward for deep, autonomous reasoning and coding, yet potentially an underwhelming "incremental" update for casual conversationalists.Following early access periods and today's broader rollout, executives, developers, and analysts have taken to X (formerly Twitter) and company blogs to share their first testing results. Here is a roundup of the first reactions to OpenAI’s latest flagship model."AI as a serious analyst"The strongest praise for GPT-5.2 centers on its ability to handle "hard problems" that require extended thinking time.Matt Shumer, CEO of HyperWriteAI, did not mince words in his review, calling GPT-5.2 Pro "the best model in the world." Shumer highlighted the model's tenacity, noting that "it thinks for **over an hour** on hard problems. And it nails tasks no other model can touch."This sentiment was echoed by Allie K. Miller, an AI entrepreneur and former AWS executive. Miller described the model as a step toward "AI as a serious analyst" rather than a "friendly companion.""The thinking and problem-solving feel noticeably stronger," Miller wrote on X. "It gives much deeper explanations than I’m used to seeing. At one point it literally wrote code to improve its own OCR in the middle of a task."Enterprise gains: Box reports distinct performance jumpsFor the enterprise sector, the update appears to be even more significant. Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, revealed on X that his company has been testing GPT-5.2 in early access. Levie reported that the model performs "7 points better than GPT-5.1" on their expanded reasoning tests, which approximate real-world knowledge work in financial services and life sciences."The model performed the majority of the tasks far faster than GPT-5.1 and GPT-5 as well," Levie noted, confirming that Box AI will be rolling out GPT-5.2 integration shortly.Rutuja Rajwade, a Senior Product Marketing Manager at Box, expanded on this in a company blog post, citing specific latency improvements. "Complex extraction" tasks dropped from 46 seconds on GPT-5 to just 12 seconds with GPT-5.2. Rajwade also noted a jump in reasoning capabilities for the Media and Entertainment vertical, rising from 76% accuracy in GPT-5.1 to 81% in the new model.A "serious leap" for coding and simulationDevelopers are finding GPT-5.2 particularly potent for "one-shot" generation of complex code structures.Pietro Schirano, CEO of magicpathai, shared a video of the model building a full 3D graphics engine in a single file with interactive controls. "It’s a serious leap forward in complex reasoning, math, coding, and simulations," Schirano posted. "The pace of progress is unreal."Similarly, Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and longtime LLM and AI power user and writer, demonstrated the model's ability to create a visually complex shader—an infinite neo-gothic city in a stormy ocean—via a single prompt.The Agentic Era: Long-running autonomyPerhaps the most functional shift is the model's ability to stay on task for hours without losing the thread.Dan Shipper, CEO of thoughtful AI testing newsletter Every, reported that the model successfully performed a profit and loss (P&L) analysis that required it to work autonomously for two hours. "It did a P&L analysis where it worked for 2 hours and gave me great results," Shipper wrote.However, Shipper also noted that for day-to-day tasks, the update feels "mostly incremental." In an article for Every, Katie Parrott wrote that while GPT-5.2 excels at instruction following, it is "less resourceful" than competitors like Claude Opus 4.5 in certain contexts, such as deducing a user's location from email data.The downsides: Speed and RigidityDespite the reasoning capabilities, the "feel" of the model has drawn critique.Shumer highlighted a significant "speed penalty" when using the model's Thinking mode. "In my experience the Thinking mode is very slow for most questions," Shumer wrote in his deep-dive review. "I almost never use Instant."Allie Miller also pointed out issues with the model's default behavior. "The downside is tone and format," she noted. "The default voice felt a bit more rigid, and the length/markdown behavior is extreme: a simple question turned into 58 bullets and numbered points."The VerdictThe early reaction suggests that GPT-5.2 is a tool optimized for power users, developers, and enterprise agents rather than casual chat. As Shumer summarized in his review: "For deep research, complex reasoning, and tasks that benefit from careful thought, GPT-5.2 Pro is the best option available right now."However, for users seeking creative writing or quick, fluid answers, models like Claude Opus 4.5 remain strong competitors. "My favorite model remains Claude Opus 4.5," Miller admitted, "but my complex ChatGPT work will get a nice incremental boost."

- [OpenAI's GPT-5.2 is here: what enterprises need to know](https://venturebeat.com/ai/openais-gpt-5-2-is-here-what-enterprises-need-to-know) — 10:16 · VentureBeat AI
  > The rumors were true: OpenAI on Thursday announced the release of its new frontier large language model (LLM) family, GPT-5.2.It comes at a pivotal moment for the AI pioneer, which has faced intensifying pressure since rival Google’s Gemini 3 LLM seized the top spot on major third-party performance leaderboards and many key benchmarks last month, though OpenAI leaders stressed in a press briefing that the timing of this release had been discussed and worked on well in advance of the release of Gemini 3.OpenAI describes GPT-5.2 as its "most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work," aiming to reclaim the performance crown with significant gains in reasoning, coding, and agentic workflows."It’s our most advanced frontier model and the strongest yet in the market for professional use," Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, said during a press briefing today. "We designed 5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people. It's better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long context, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects."GPT-5.2 features a massive 400,000-token context window — allowing it to ingest hundreds of documents or large code repositories at once — and a 128,000 max output token limit, enabling it to generate extensive reports or full applications in a single go.The model also features a knowledge cutoff of August 31, 2025, ensuring it is up-to-date with relatively recent world events and technical documentation. It explicitly includes "Reasoning token support," confirming the underlying architecture uses the chain-of-thought processing popularized by the "o1" series.The 'Code Red' Reality CheckThe release arrives following The Information's report of an emergency "Code Red" directive to OpenAI staff from CEO Sam Altman to improve ChaTGPT — a move reportedly designed to mobilize resources following the "quality gap" exposed by Gemini 3. The Verge similarly reported on the timing of GPT-5.2's release ahead of the official announcement. During the briefing, OpenAI executives acknowledged the directive but pushed back on the narrative that the model was rushed solely to answer Google."It is important to note this has been in the works for many, many months," Simo told reporters. She clarified that while the "Code Red" helped focus the company, it wasn't the sole driver of the timeline. "We announced this Code Red to really signal to the company that we want to marshal resources in one particular area... but that's not the reason it's coming out this week in particular."Max Schwarzer, lead of OpenAI's post-training team, echoed this sentiment to dispel the idea of a panic launch. "We've been planning for this release since a very long time ago... this specific week we talked about many months ago."A spokesperson from OpenAI further clarified that the "Code Red" call applied to ChatGPT as a product, not solely underlying model development or the release of new models.Under the Hood: Instant, Thinking, and ProOpenAI is segmenting the GPT-5.2 release into three distinct tiers within ChatGPT, a strategy likely designed to balance the massive compute costs of "reasoning" models with user demand for speed:GPT-5.2 Instant: Optimized for speed and daily tasks like writing, translation, and information seeking.GPT-5.2 Thinking: Designed for "complex, structured work" and long-running agents, this model leverages deeper reasoning chains to handle coding, math, and multi-step projects.GPT-5.2 Pro: The new heavyweight champion. OpenAI describes this as its "smartest and most trustworthy option," delivering the highest accuracy for difficult questions where quality outweighs latency.For developers, the models are available immediately in the application programming interface (API) as gpt-5.2, gpt-5.2-chat-latest (Instant), and gpt-5.2-pro.The Numbers: Beating the BenchmarksThe GPT-5.2 release includes leading metrics across most domains — specifically those that target the "professional knowledge work" gap where competitors have recently gained ground.OpenAI highlighted a new benchmark called GDPval, which measures performance on "well-specified knowledge work tasks" across 44 occupations. "GPT-5.2 Thinking is now state-of-the-art on that benchmark... and beats or ties top industry professionals on 70.9% of well-specified professional tasks like spreadsheets, presentations, and document creation, according to expert human judges," Simo said.In the critical arena of coding, OpenAI is claiming a decisive lead. Schwarzer noted that on SWE-bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering, GPT-5.2 Thinking sets a new state-of-the-art score of 55.6%. He emphasized that this benchmark is "more contamination resistant, challenging, diverse, and industrially relevant than previous benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified."Other key benchmark results include:GPQA Diamond (Science): GPT-5.2 Pro scored 93.2%, edging out GPT-5.2 Thinking (92.4%) and surpassing GPT-5.1 Thinking (88.1%).FrontierMath: On Tier 1-3 problems, GPT-5.2 Thinking solved 40.3%, a significant jump from the 31.0% achieved by its predecessor.ARC-AGI-1: GPT-5.2 Pro is reportedly the first model to cross the 90% threshold on this general reasoning benchmark, scoring 90.5%The Price of IntelligencePerformance comes at a premium. While ChatGPT subscription pricing remains unchanged for now, the API costs for the new flagship models are steep compared to previous generations, reflecting the high compute demands of "thinking" mode. They're also on the upper-end of API costs for the industry.  GPT-5.2 Thinking: Priced at $1.75 per 1 million input tokens and $14 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Pro: The costs jump significantly to $21 per 1 million input tokens and $168 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Thinking is priced 40% higher in the API than the standard GPT-5.1 ($1.25/$10), signaling that OpenAI views the new reasoning capabilities as a tangible value-add rather than a mere efficiency update.The high-end GPT-5.2 Pro follows the same pattern, costing 40% more than the previous GPT-5 Pro ($15/$120). While expensive, it still undercuts OpenAI’s most specialized reasoning model, o1-pro, which remains the most costly offering on the menu at a staggering $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens.OpenAI argues that despite the higher per-token cost, the model’s "greater token efficiency" and ability to solve tasks in fewer turns make it economically viable for high-value enterprise workflows.Here's how it compares to the current API costs for other competing models across the LLM field:ModelInput (/1M)Output (/1M)Total CostSourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba CloudGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIdeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekQwen 3 Plus$0.40$1.20$1.60Alibaba CloudERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25QianfanClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen-Max$1.60$6.40$8.00Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicClaude Opus 4.5$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIImage Generation: Nothing New Yet...But 'More to Come'During the briefing, VentureBeat asked the OpenAI participants if the new release included any boost to image generation capabilities, noting the excitement around similar features in recent competitor launches like Google's Gemini 3 Image aka Nano Banana Pro. Unfortunately for those seeking to recreate the kind of text-and-information heavy graphics and image editing capabilities, OpenAI executives clarified that GPT-5.2 comes with no current image improvements over the prior GPT-5.1 and OpenAI's integrated DALL-E 3 and gpt-4o native image generation models."On image Gen, nothing to announce today, but more to come," Simo said. She acknowledged the popularity of the feature, adding, "We know this is a very important use case that people love, that we introduced [to] the market, and so definitely more to come there." Aidan Clark, OpenAI's lead of training, also declined to comment on visual generation specifics, stating simply, "I can't really speak to image Gen myself." The 'Mega-Agent' EraBeyond raw scores, OpenAI is positioning GPT-5.2 as the engine for a new generation of "long-running agents" capable of executing multi-step workflows without human hand-holding."Box found that 5.2 can extract information from long, complex documents about 40% faster, and also saw a 40% boost in reasoning accuracy for Life Sciences and healthcare," Simo said. She also noted that Notion reported the model "outperforms 5.1 across every dimension... and it excels at the kind of really ambiguous, longer rising tasks that define real knowledge work."Schwarzer added that coding startups like Augment Code found the model "delivered substantially stronger deep code capabilities than any prior model," which is why it was selected to power their new code review agent.Visual capabilities have also seen an upgrade. OpenAI's release blog post shows an example where "a traveler reports a delayed flight, a missed connection, an overnight stay in New York, and a medical seating requirement."The outcome? "GPT‑5.2 manages the entire chain of tasks—rebooking, special-assistance seating, and compensation—delivering a more complete outcome than GPT‑5.1."A new evaluation called ScreenSpot-Pro, which tests a model's ability to understand GUI screenshots, shows GPT-5.2 Thinking achieving 86.3% accuracy, compared to just 64.2% for GPT-5.1.Science and ReliabilityOpenAI leaders also stressed the model's utility for scientific research, attempting to move the conversation beyond simple chatbots to research assistants. Aidan Clark, lead of the training team, shared an example of a senior immunology researcher testing the model."They tested it by asking it to generate the most important unanswered questions about the immune system," Clark said. "That immunology researcher reported that GPT-5.2 produced sharper questions and stronger explanations for why those questions... matter compared to any previous pro model."Reliability was another key focus. Schwarzer claimed the new model "hallucinates substantially less than GPT-5.1," noting that on a set of de-identified queries, "responses contained errors 38% less often."The 'Vibe' ShiftInterestingly, OpenAI acknowledged that not every user might immediately prefer the new models. When asked why legacy models like GPT-5.1 would remain available, Schwarzer admitted that "models change a little bit every time."Some users may find that they prefer the vibes of the previous model, even though we think the latest one is across the board generally much better," Schwarzer said. He also noted that for some enterprise customers who have "really fine-tuned a prompt for a specific model," there might be "small regressions," necessitating access to the older versions.Safety, 'Adult Mode,' and Future RoadmapAddressing safety concerns, Simo confirmed that the company is preparing to roll out an "Adult Mode" in the first quarter of next year, following the implementation of a new age prediction system."We're in the process of improving that," Simo said regarding the age prediction technology. "We want to do that ahead of launching adult mode."Looking further ahead, industry reports suggest OpenAI is working on a more fundamental architectural shift under the codename "Project Garlic," targeting a flagship release in early 2026. While executives did not comment on specific future roadmaps during the briefing, Simo remained optimistic about the economics of their current trajectory."If you look at historical trends, compute has increased about 3x every year for the last three years," she explained. "Revenue has also increased at the same pace... creating this virtuous cycle."Clark added that efficiency is improving rapidly: "The model we're releasing today achieves an even better score [on ARC-AGI] with almost 400 times less cost and less compute associated with it" compared to models from a year ago.GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro begin rolling out in ChatGPT today to paid users (Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise). The company notes the rollout will be gradual to maintain stability.

  > Marble, a startup building artificial intelligence agents for tax professionals, has raised $9 million in seed funding as the accounting industry grapples with a deepening labor shortage and mounting regulatory complexity.The round, led by Susa Ventures with participation from MXV Capital and Konrad Capital, positions Marble to compete in a market where AI adoption has lagged significantly behind other knowledge industries like law and software development."When we looked at the economy and asked ourselves where AI is going to transform the way businesses operate, we focused on knowledge industries — specifically businesses with hourly fee-based service models," said Bhavin Shah, Marble's chief executive officer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. "Accounting generates $250 billion in fee-based billing in the US every year. There's a tremendous opportunity to increase efficiency and improve margins for accounting firms."The company has launched a free AI-powered tax research tool on its website that converts complex government tax data into accessible, citation-backed answers for practitioners. Marble plans to expand into AI agents that can analyze compliance scenarios and eventually automate portions of tax preparation workflows.Marble's backers share Shah's conviction about the market. "Marble is rethinking the accounting system from the ground up. Accounting is one of the biggest — and most overlooked — markets in professional services," Chad Byers, general partner at Susa Ventures, told VentureBeat. "We've known Bhavin from his time as an executive in the Susa portfolio, and have seen firsthand how sharp and execution-driven he is. He and Geordie bring the perfect mix of operational depth and product instinct to a space long overdue for change — and they see the same massive opportunity we do."The accounting industry lost 340,000 workers in four years — and replacements aren't comingMarble enters a market shaped by structural forces that have fundamentally altered the economics of professional accounting.The accounting profession has shed roughly 340,000 workers since 2019, a 17% decline that has left firms scrambling to meet client demands. First-time candidates for the Certified Public Accountant exam dropped 33% between 2016 and 2021, according to AICPA data, and 2022 saw the lowest number of exam takers in 17 years.The exodus comes as baby boomers exit en masse. The American Institute of CPAs estimates that approximately 75% of all licensed CPAs reached retirement age by 2019, creating a demographic cliff that the profession has struggled to address.“Fewer CPAs are getting certified year over year," Shah said. "The industry is compressing at the same time that there's more work to be done and the tax code is getting more complicated."The National Pipeline Advisory Group, a multi-stakeholder body formed by the AICPA in July 2023, released a report identifying the 150-hour education requirement for CPA licensure as a significant barrier to entry. A separate survey by the Center for Audit Quality found that 57% of business majors who chose not to pursue accounting cited the additional credit hours as a deterrent.Recent legislative changes reflect the urgency. Ohio now offers alternatives to the 150-hour requirement, signaling that states are willing to experiment with pathways that could reverse enrollment declines.Why AI transformed law and software development but left accounting behindDespite the profession's challenges, AI adoption in accounting has moved more slowly than in adjacent knowledge industries. Harvey and Legora have raised hundreds of millions to bring AI to legal work. Cursor and other coding assistants have transformed software development. Accounting, by contrast, remains largely dependent on legacy research platforms and manual processes.Geordie Konrad, Marble's executive chairman and a co-founder of restaurant software company TouchBistro, attributes the gap to how people conceptualize AI's capabilities.“It was obvious to many people that LLMs could do meaningful work by manipulating code for software developers and manipulating words for lawyers. In the accounting industry, LLMs are going to be used as reasoning agents," Konrad said. " That requires a bit more of a two-step analysis to see why it's a big opportunity."The technical challenge is substantial. Tax regulations form one of the most complex, interconnected information systems that humans have created — tens of thousands of interlocking rules, guidance documents, and jurisdiction-specific requirements that frequently overlap or conflict."If you want to put AI through its paces and ask how far it's come in replicating cognitive functions, this is an unbelievable playground to work in," Konrad said.A dramatic shift: AI adoption among tax and finance teams doubles in one yearRecent data suggests the accounting profession's stance toward AI is shifting rapidly.A 2025 survey from Hanover Research and Avalara found that 84% of finance and tax teams now use AI heavily in their operations, up from 47% in 2024. The 2025 Generative AI in Professional Services Report from Thomson Reuters Institute found that 21% of tax firms already use generative AI technology, with 53% either planning to adopt it or actively considering it.Large accounting firms have invested heavily in AI infrastructure. Deloitte has developed generative AI capabilities within its audit platform. BDO announced a $1B investment in AI over the next five years. EY launched an AI platform combining technology with strategy, transactions, and tax services. PwC estimates a complete AI-driven audit solution will launch by 2026.But adoption at smaller firms remains uneven. According to Thomson Reuters research, 52% of tax firm respondents who use generative AI rely on open-source tools like ChatGPT rather than industry-specific solutions—a pattern that could shift as purpose-built alternatives emerge.Marble's founders believe the hesitance stems not from technophobia but from a lack of compelling options.“Firms want to embrace AI," Shah said. “They just haven't seen great software and tooling made for them. That's part of the opportunity — to work with them and build something they're excited to use on a day-to-day basis.”Can artificial intelligence rescue accounting's billable-hour business model?AI's arrival in accounting raises questions about the profession's billing structure.Accounting firms have traditionally generated profits by billing clients for staff time, often at multiples of employee compensation costs. Junior associates performing compliance work represent a significant revenue stream. If AI can automate that work, does it undercut the business model firms depend on?Marble's founders argue the opposite. The chronic staffing shortage has already constrained firms' ability to capture available revenue. Advisory and consulting work — higher-margin services that clients actively want — goes undone because practitioners are buried in compliance tasks."Everyone in the industry agrees that an enormous amount of advisory work simply isn't getting done," Konrad said. "Customers want it. Firms want to do it because it's high-margin, great work. But nobody gets to it."The 2025 AICPA National Management of an Accounting Practice Survey supports this view. Firms reported a median 6.7% increase in net client fees over the prior year, with growth in audit, assurance, tax services, and client accounting advisory. Net remaining per partner climbed 11.9% from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024, reaching $252,663.The survey also found growing interest in AI adoption, though most firms have yet to allocate formal budgets or develop structured training programs. Continued adoption, the survey suggested, could help expand services and fuel continued growth.Accountants won't adopt AI tools they can't trust with sensitive client dataFor AI to succeed in accounting, it must clear a high bar for data security. Accounting firms handle some of the most sensitive financial information in the economy. Practitioners cannot adopt tools that create compliance or confidentiality risks.According to Avalara's survey, 63% of respondents cited data security and privacy concerns as the top barriers to automating tax and finance functions. The concern persists throughout the adoption lifecycle, from initial selection through implementation and ongoing use.Marble has made security a foundational priority. The company obtained software compliance certification before releasing any product and maintains that data privacy is embedded in its operational culture from day one."Security is at the core of what we are building," Shah said. "Every employee knows that security is critical. It's a part of our onboarding and something that we consider in everything we do."From number crunchers to strategic advisors: How AI could reshape accounting careersMarble's founders reject the narrative that AI will only take away from accounting jobs. They propose instead that AI will result in accounting jobs becoming more strategic and less characterized by repetitive execution. They draw an analogy to architecture, where computer-aided design replaced laborious manual drafting. Architects did not disappear — they gained tools that let them spend more time on creative design and less on mechanical reproduction."If you take some of the hours-intensive, less creative work out of what being a junior or intermediate accountant is, and you replace it with a role where you're a professional who is being creative, synthesizing ideas, and able to delegate a lot of tasks to AI assistant platform solutions, you end up with an industry that's just a lot more fun to operate in," Konrad said.The shift could also improve client outcomes. When accountants spend less time on compliance, they can invest more in the strategic advisory work that clients value."Not only does the work become more enjoyable because of what you can focus on, but that's also what your clients are going to value more from you," Shah said.The competitive landscape: Marble faces well-funded rivals and legacy giantsMarble enters a market with formidable incumbents and well-funded competitors. BlueJ, a global tax research platform, has raised over $100 million. Thomson Reuters, CCH, and Intuit have deep customer relationships built over decades.But the founders see opportunity in the transition moment."AI has changed what’s possible in the industry," Shah said. "We are going to work with and integrate with some technology players in the industry and also compete with other players with new products powered by AI. In some cases we are going to forget about the existing technology solution for doing things and go back to the task itself. We have totally new technological capabilities — how would you design something from a blank canvas that works with humans to accomplish that task?""The decision to offer a free research tool reflects Marble's go-to-market philosophy. By giving practitioners access without a paywall, the company aims to build trust and demonstrate capability."It allows us to expose a really compelling product that is purpose-built to those that are worried about how to use AI or question how to adopt it.  Now they don’t have to think about purchasing something that is cost-prohibitive when they don't know how to integrate it into their workflow," Shah said.The $250 billion question: Can a startup transform how America does its taxes?Marble's roadmap extends beyond research. The company plans to develop AI agents capable of analyzing complex tax scenarios, identifying compliance issues, and eventually automating significant portions of compliance workflows — all while keeping practitioners in control.The founders frame success not in terms of disruption but rebalancing. Today's tax work skews heavily toward compliance, leaving the strategic advisory services that clients crave — and that generate higher margins—perpetually undone. Marble's bet is that AI can flip that equation."Everyone wants it to look more like compliance is done simpler, and you spend time talking about strategy and planning," Konrad said. "How do we change that blend of compliance versus strategy and planning to strategy and planning first—with compliance as something that has been made dramatically simpler?"Whether Marble can execute on that vision remains to be seen. The company faces entrenched competitors, a profession that has historically resisted technological change, and the inherent unpredictability of building AI systems for high-stakes financial work.But the founders are betting that the industry's demographic shift will accelerate adoption in ways that previous technology waves could not. With fewer accountants entering the profession each year and client demands only growing, firms may have an increased appetite to embrace tools that let their remaining staff do more."AI is going to change every industry — in some cases in ways that will help business models and in some cases in ways that will challenge them. We believe AI is ultimately going to make accounting firms’ businesses better and more profitable and at the same time end clients will get better services at better prices," Shah said.The accounting profession, it seems, is about to find out which side of that equation it lands on.

- [Nous Research just released Nomos 1, an open-source AI that ranks second on the notoriously brutal Putnam math exam](https://venturebeat.com/ai/nous-research-just-released-nomos-1-an-open-source-ai-that-ranks-second-on) — 01:30 · VentureBeat AI
  > Nous Research, the San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, released on Tuesday an open-source mathematical reasoning system called Nomos 1 that achieved near-elite human performance on this year's William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, one of the most prestigious and notoriously difficult undergraduate math contests in the world.The Putnam is known for its difficulty: While a perfect score is 120, this year's top score was 90, and the median was just 2. Nomos 1, by contrast, scored 87 points — a result that would have ranked second out of 3,988 participants in the 2024 competition, according to the company.The release marks an inflection point in the rapidly accelerating race to build AI systems capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning. Unlike the massive, compute-intensive models deployed by major technology companies, Nomos 1 achieves its results with a relatively compact architecture: 30 billion parameters with roughly 3 billion active at any given time, using a mixture-of-experts design based on Alibaba's Qwen3 model."This score would rank #2/3988 in 2024 and marks our first step with Hillclimb AI towards creating a SOTA AI mathematician," Nous Research announced on social media Tuesday.The same base model scored 24 points without Nous Research's specialized trainingPerhaps most striking is the gap between Nomos 1 and its base model. When Nous Research ran the same Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 model through an identical testing harness, it scored just 24 out of 120 — a result that underscores the critical importance of post-training optimization and specialized reasoning techniques over raw model scale."Nomos 1 achieved an 87/120 with 8 perfect scores," the company stated, noting that the performance difference "is largely due to post-training and data quality rather than the harness."The results were verified through blind grading by a human expert who had previously finished in the top 200 on the Putnam. Nous Research provided the anonymized submissions to the grader, then published the full set of de-anonymized files and the runbooks used to generate them on GitHub.Why the Putnam competition is considered the ultimate test of mathematical reasoningThe William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is an annual mathematics competition for undergraduate college students enrolled at institutions of higher learning in the United States and Canada. It is widely considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics competition in the world.The notoriously brutal William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is more of a mathematical sporting event than an academic test. The exam consists of two 3-hour sessions separated by a 2-hour break. There are a total of 12 questions to be solved, 6 for each session. Each question is worth 10 points, for a total of 120 points.Putnam questions are not the type that come up in regular exams or textbooks. They are more like puzzles than calculations, often requiring students to find different ways to represent things before a solution might unfold.Last year, nearly 4,000 students across the continent wrote the Putnam. Sixty-one per cent scored three points or fewer, according to the Mathematical Association of America, which organizes the competition. The top score was 90 out of 120.Many Putnam Fellows have gone on to become distinguished researchers in mathematics and other fields, including three Fields Medalists — John Milnor, David Mumford, and Daniel Quillen — and two Nobel laureates in physics — Richard Feynman and Kenneth Wilson.Inside the two-phase reasoning system that powers Nomos 1's mathematical breakthroughsNomos 1 is a specialization of Qwen's Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking model, optimized for mathematical problem-solving and proof-writing in natural language. The system was developed in collaboration with Hillclimb AI.What distinguishes Nomos 1 from simple model inference is its sophisticated reasoning harness — an open-source framework that orchestrates how the model approaches and solves problems. The harness operates in two distinct phases within a three-hour time limit, mirroring the actual Putnam competition structure.In the solving phase, parallel workers simultaneously tackle problems using a priority-based system. Each worker picks a problem, generates a submission, then scores its own work on a scale of 1 to 7. Problems with the fewest perfect scores receive priority, ensuring the system focuses its compute on the hardest challenges. This process continues until either all problems have achieved a target number of self-critiqued perfect scores or time runs out.The finalization phase begins 15 minutes before the time limit (or at 50% for shorter runs) and employs a two-stage selection process. First, a consolidation step groups submissions by conclusion and attempts to identify the correct group — importantly, not necessarily the majority group. Then, a pairwise tournament using single elimination determines the final submission for each problem."Our open source reasoning system consists of a solving phase, where workers attempt a least-solved problem and self-assess, followed by a finalization phase, which consolidates submissions to choose a final submission for each problem," Nous Research explained.How Nomos 1 compares to mathematical AI systems from DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAIThe Nomos 1 results arrive amid a flurry of advances in mathematical reasoning AI. DeepSeek's model, DeepSeekMath-V2, scored 118 out of 120 points on questions from the 2024 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, beating the top human score of 90. The model also performed at the level of gold-medal winners in the International Mathematical Olympiad.This year, Google's advanced Gemini model operated end-to-end in natural language, producing rigorous mathematical proofs directly from the official problem descriptions – all within the 4.5-hour competition time limit. They achieved this year's result using an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think.What makes Nomos 1's achievement notable is not raw performance — it trails DeepSeek's 118/120 — but rather its accessibility and efficiency. At 30 billion parameters with only 3 billion active, the model can run on consumer-grade hardware, a stark contrast to the massive compute clusters required by frontier models from OpenAI and Google.Hermes 4.3 arrived just six days earlier, trained on a decentralized blockchain networkThe Nomos 1 announcement follows closely on the heels of Nous Research's December 3 release of Hermes 4.3, a general-purpose language model that marked another significant milestone for the company.Hermes 4.3, based on ByteDance's Seed-OSS-36B-Base model, is the first production model that Nous Research trained entirely on its Psyche network — a distributed training infrastructure that uses a novel optimizer called DisTrO to coordinate training across nodes spread throughout data centers over the open internet, secured by consensus on the Solana blockchain.The company trained Hermes 4.3 both through traditional centralized methods and on the Psyche network, specifically to verify that distributed training could match or exceed centralized performance for production workloads. The Psyche-trained version outperformed the centralized version across a suite of downstream tasks, the company reported."The training run proved stable throughout, averaging 144k tokens/second spread across 24 Psyche nodes," Nous Research stated. "Using DisTrO's overlapped collective strategy, the entirety of the P2P communications were hidden by the training time, effectively achieving equivalent throughput to traditional, centralized training."Hermes 4.3 also achieved state-of-the-art results on RefusalBench, a new benchmark that measures a model's willingness to be helpful across a variety of scenarios commonly restricted by other models. The model answered 74.60% of RefusalBench questions in non-reasoning mode, surpassing its predecessor Hermes 4 70B (59.50%) and outperforming closed models including Grok 4 (51.30%) and Gemini 2.5 Pro (24.23%).Small models with smart training are closing the gap with trillion-parameter giantsTogether, the two releases in a single week signal Nous Research's strategic bet: that smaller, more efficient models with sophisticated post-training techniques and reasoning harnesses can compete with — and in some cases outperform — the massive models developed by better-funded competitors.For enterprise decision-makers, the implications are significant. Mathematical reasoning capabilities have applications far beyond academic competitions: they're essential for formal verification, theorem proving, scientific modeling, cryptographic analysis, and any domain requiring rigorous logical deduction.The open-source nature of both releases — Nomos 1 is available under the Apache 2.0 license on Hugging Face, with the full reasoning harness on GitHub — means that organizations can deploy these capabilities on their own infrastructure without relying on API calls to major cloud providers."For the first time, anyone can run or access a state-of-the-art AI mathematician," one observer noted on social media. "This lowers the barrier to serious math research, proof verification, modeling complex systems, advanced reasoning work."The key contributors to Nomos 1 include Roger Jin, who led the training; Jeffrey Quesnelle and Dakota Mahan, who built the infrastructure; Chen Guang, who advised; and Ryan Teknium and Jeffrey Quesnelle, who provided leadership. The model was developed with contributions from Hillclimb AI and a team of math experts including Samuel Kim, Miron Yurkevich, and others.The race to build AI mathematicians is accelerating faster than anyone predictedThe 86th Putnam Competition took place on Saturday, December 6, 2025 — just three days before Nous Research released Nomos 1. The timing underscores how rapidly the field is moving: companies are now releasing mathematical AI systems capable of near-elite human performance within days of the competitions they're designed to solve.Competition in mathematical AI has intensified dramatically in recent months. In July, an advanced version of Google DeepMind's Gemini model and an experimental reasoning model from OpenAI both achieved gold status on the IMO 2025. DeepSeek's new model matched their performance, solving 5 out of 6 problems.But the resource requirements for those frontier systems remain prohibitive for most organizations. OpenAI's o1-pro is estimated at over 1.8 trillion parameters; Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro likely exceeds 400 billion. Nomos 1, by contrast, achieves competitive results with a fraction of that footprint.The gap between massive frontier models and efficient open-source alternatives is narrowing. And for organizations that need mathematical reasoning capabilities without the budget for hyperscale compute, that gap may have just closed enough to matter.As one observer put it on social media: "This marks a significant jump for AI math models that are small enough to run on your laptop."A laptop that can now outperform nearly 4,000 of the continent's best undergraduate mathematicians.
